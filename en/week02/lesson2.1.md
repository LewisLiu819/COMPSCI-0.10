# Lesson 2.1: Thinking Like a Computer

Welcome, programmers! Today, you get to be in charge of a robot. The catch? It's a *human* robot, and it will follow your instructions *exactly* as you say them. Let's learn how to give perfect commands!

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to:
- Explain that an "algorithm" is just a fancy word for a list of steps.
- Write a clear, step-by-step algorithm for a simple task.
- Spot instructions that are confusing or missing a step.
- Understand why programmers have to be super precise.

## Our Mission for Today

### Human Robot Training (20 minutes)
- First, your teacher will become a "robot" to show you how it works. You'll give commands and see what happens when a robot takes your words literally!
- Then, it's your turn! In teams, one person will be the "programmer" and the other will be the "robot." Can you guide your robot to do things like walk to the board or pick up a book?

### Algorithm Workshop (20 minutes)
- Let's learn the secret programmer's word: **Algorithm**. It's just a recipe, or a set of instructions, for the computer to follow.
- As a class, we'll write an algorithm together for a daily task, like how to brush your teeth.
- With a partner, you'll write your own algorithm for tying a shoe or making a paper airplane. Then, you'll test it by having your partner follow your instructions precisely!

### Debugging Practice (8 minutes)
- Now for a challenge! We'll look at some instruction lists that are broken.
- Your job is to be a "debugger" and find the missing, mixed-up, or unclear steps.
- We'll practice fixing (or "debugging") the algorithms together.

### Mission Debrief (2 minutes)
- "What was the hardest part about giving instructions to your human robot?"
- We'll connect this fun activity to why real computer programming needs such careful thinking.

## Your Programmer's Toolkit
- Big paper for writing our class algorithms
- Markers and pencils
- Everyday objects for our robots to use (books, pencils, etc.)
- Some pre-written "broken" algorithms for us to debug
- Algorithm worksheets to help you write your steps

## How to Be a Master Programmer
- We'll see how clearly you can give instructions during the Human Robot game.
- **Your Mission Report:** A partner will try to follow your written algorithm. If they can do it successfully, your mission is a success!

## Fun at Home
- Write down the algorithm for your morning routine. See if a family member can follow your instructions *exactly*. Does it work?

## New Tech Words to Master
- **Algorithm:** A list of step-by-step instructions for completing a task.
- **Instructions:** The commands you give to a computer or a robot.
- **Sequence:** The specific order of the steps. Getting the sequence right is very important!
- **Debug:** To find and fix errors or problems in a set of instructions.
