# Lesson 2.1: Thinking Like a Computer

**Duration:** 50 minutes
**Format:** Unplugged Activity + Introduction to Algorithms
**Unit:** What is Computer Science? (Week 1-2)

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Define "algorithm" in kid-friendly terms
- Write step-by-step instructions for a simple task
- Identify when instructions are too vague or missing steps
- Understand that computers need very precise instructions

## Lesson Structure

### Human Robot Activity (20 minutes)
- Teacher demonstrates being a "robot" following literal instructions
- Students give instructions for simple tasks (walk to the board, pick up a book)
- Highlight how robots/computers follow instructions exactly
- Students take turns being "robots" and "programmers"

### Algorithm Writing Workshop (20 minutes)
- Introduce the term "algorithm" as a fancy word for step-by-step instructions
- Collaborative writing: Algorithm for brushing teeth
- Partner activity: Write algorithms for tying shoes or making a paper airplane
- Test algorithms by having partners follow them exactly

### Debugging Practice (8 minutes)
- Present intentionally flawed algorithms
- Students identify missing or unclear steps
- Practice fixing (debugging) the instructions

### Reflection Circle (2 minutes)
- "What was challenging about giving instructions to our human robots?"
- Connect to why programming requires precision

## Materials Needed
- Large chart paper for algorithm writing
- Markers and pencils
- Simple props for robot activities (books, pencils, etc.)
- Pre-written flawed algorithms for debugging practice
- Algorithm template worksheets

## Assessment

### Formative
- Observation during human robot activities
- Quality of algorithm writing (completeness, clarity)
- Participation in debugging exercises

### Performance Assessment
Students successfully guide a partner through their written algorithm.

## Cross-Curricular Connections
