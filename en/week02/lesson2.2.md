# Lesson 2.2: The Great Peanut Butter Sandwich Challenge

**Duration:** 50 minutes
**Format:** Hands-on Algorithm Practice + Introduction to Programming
**Unit:** What is Computer Science? (Week 1-2)

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Write detailed, unambiguous algorithms
- Recognize the importance of precision in instructions
- Connect algorithm writing to computer programming
- Demonstrate improved instruction-giving skills

## Lesson Structure

### Setup and Challenge Introduction (10 minutes)
- Review what algorithms are
- Present the challenge: Write instructions for making a peanut butter sandwich
- Emphasize that instructions will be followed EXACTLY
- Safety review for food activity

### Algorithm Writing Time (15 minutes)
- Students work individually or in pairs
- Provide algorithm template for structure
- Encourage detailed, step-by-step thinking
- Teacher circulates to ask probing questions

### The Great Testing (20 minutes)
- Teacher (or volunteer) follows several algorithms exactly as written
- Hilarious results when instructions are too vague
- Students observe and take notes on problems
- Celebrate both successes and learning opportunities

### Revision and Improvement (10 minutes)
- Students revise their algorithms based on observations
- Partner sharing of improved versions
- Discuss what makes instructions clear vs. confusing

### Connection to Programming (5 minutes)
- Explain how this connects to computer programming
- Preview upcoming lessons with programming tools
- Show simple example of programming blocks

## Materials Needed
- Bread, peanut butter, jelly, plastic knives, paper plates
- Napkins and cleanup supplies
- Algorithm writing templates
- Chart paper for displaying successful algorithms
- Simple visual of programming blocks for preview

## Assessment

### Formative
- Initial algorithm completeness
- Quality of observations during testing
- Improvement shown in algorithm revision

### Summative
Compare original and revised algorithms using a simple rubric (clear steps, logical order, completeness).

## Safety Considerations
- Check for food allergies before activity
- Use plastic knives only
- Have hand sanitizer available
- Prepare allergy-friendly alternatives (sunbutter, etc.)

## Extension Activities
- Try the activity with other simple tasks (making a paper airplane, drawing a house)
- Create illustrated algorithm books for younger students
- Connect to family recipes and cooking instructions

## Real-World Connections
- Cooking recipes as algorithms
- GPS directions as algorithms
- Assembly instructions for toys/furniture
- Emergency procedures as algorithms

## Vocabulary Reinforced
- Algorithm
- Precise/Precision
- Instructions
- Debug
- Revise/Revision
