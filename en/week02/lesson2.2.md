# Lesson 2.2: The Great Peanut Butter Sandwich Challenge

Get ready for the messiest, funniest, and most delicious challenge yet! Today, you'll write the perfect algorithm for a simple task: making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. But will your instructions be clear enough for a computer (or your teacher!) to follow?

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this challenge, you'll be able to:
- Write a super detailed, step-by-step algorithm that anyone can follow.
- See with your own eyes why being precise is so important in programming.
- Connect the fun of writing a recipe to the real work of writing code.
- Get even better at giving crystal-clear instructions.

## The Challenge Plan

### Mission Briefing (10 minutes)
- Let's quickly review: what's an algorithm?
- Today's mission is presented: Write a perfect, complete set of instructions on how to make a PB&J sandwich.
- The #1 rule is announced: The person making the sandwich can ONLY do *exactly* what is written. No guessing!
- We'll quickly go over the safety rules for our sandwich-making station.

### Algorithm Writing Time (15 minutes)
- It's time to write your masterpiece. You can work alone or with a partner.
- Use the algorithm worksheet to help you structure your steps.
- Think about every single tiny detail! Don't leave anything out.

### The Hilarious Test Kitchen (20 minutes)
- This is the best part! Your teacher (or a brave volunteer) will attempt to follow some of your algorithms, word for word.
- Get ready to laugh as you see what happens when an instruction is missing or unclear. (Did you remember to tell them to open the jar?)
- We'll take notes on what works and what doesn't, celebrating both the perfect sandwiches and the funny messes!

### Algorithm Upgrade (10 minutes)
- Based on what you saw, it's time to revise your algorithm.
- Add more detail, fix unclear steps, and make your instructions foolproof.
- Share your new-and-improved algorithms with a partner.

### Connecting to Code (5 minutes)
- Let's talk about how this crazy sandwich challenge is exactly like real computer programming.
- We'll get a sneak peek at the programming tools we'll use in the coming weeks.

## Your Challenge Supplies
- Bread, peanut butter, jelly, plastic knives, and paper plates
- Napkins and cleaning supplies (just in case!)
- Algorithm worksheets for your master instructions
- A big piece of paper to display any perfect sandwich algorithms
- A picture of what real programming blocks look like

## How to Win the Challenge
- The ultimate test is seeing your algorithm in action. How clear were your original instructions?
- **The Upgrade Award:** We'll compare your first draft to your final, revised algorithm to see how much you improved as a programmer!

## Safety First!
- We will check for any food allergies before we begin.
- We will only use plastic knives.
- We'll have hand sanitizer ready for everyone.
- Allergy-friendly options (like sunflower seed butter) will be available.

## New Tech Words to Master
- **Precise:** Being super specific and exact. No room for guessing!
- **Revise:** To look back at your work and make it better.
- **Debug:** You'll be doing this live when you see a problem and think about how to fix your instructions!
