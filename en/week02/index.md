# Week 2: Thinking Like a Computer

**Unit:** What is Computer Science? (Weeks 1-2)
**Duration:** 2 lessons, 50 minutes each

## Week Overview

Week 2 introduces students to algorithmic thinking and the importance of precise instructions. Through unplugged activities and hands-on challenges, students learn to write step-by-step instructions (algorithms) and understand why computers need very specific directions to function properly.

## Learning Goals

By the end of Week 2, students will be able to:
- Define "algorithm" in simple terms
- Write clear, step-by-step instructions for simple tasks
- Identify and fix problems in instructions (debugging)
- Understand that computers follow instructions exactly as written

## Lessons This Week

### [Lesson 2.1: Thinking Like a Computer](lesson2.1.md)
**Format:** Unplugged Activity + Introduction to Algorithms

Students learn about algorithms through the "Human Robot" activity, where they give precise instructions to their classmates and discover the importance of clear, detailed directions.

**Key Activities:**
- Human Robot demonstrations
- Algorithm writing workshop
- Debugging practice with flawed instructions
- Collaborative algorithm creation

**Vocabulary:** Algorithm, Instructions, Steps, Sequence, Debug/Debugging

### [Lesson 2.2: The Great Peanut Butter Sandwich Challenge](lesson2.2.md)
**Format:** Hands-on Algorithm Practice + Introduction to Programming

Students write detailed algorithms for making peanut butter sandwiches and watch as their instructions are followed exactly, leading to hilarious (and educational) results that demonstrate the need for precision in programming.

**Key Activities:**
- Peanut butter sandwich algorithm writing
- Live testing of student algorithms
- Algorithm revision and improvement
- Connection to computer programming concepts

**Vocabulary:** Algorithm, Precise/Precision, Instructions, Debug, Revise/Revision

## Assessment Highlights

- **Formative:** Human robot activity participation, algorithm completeness
- **Performance:** Partner successfully follows written algorithm
- **Summative:** Comparison of original vs. revised algorithms

## Cross-Curricular Connections

- **Math:** Sequencing and logical order
- **Language Arts:** Clear technical writing and instruction giving
- **Life Skills:** Following procedures and directions
- **Science:** Systematic observation and hypothesis testing

## Real-World Applications

- Cooking recipes as algorithms
- GPS navigation instructions
- Assembly instructions for toys and furniture
- Emergency procedures and safety protocols

## Safety Considerations

- Food allergy awareness and alternatives
- Safe use of plastic utensils
- Proper cleanup procedures
- Hand sanitizer availability

## Materials Needed

- Peanut butter, jelly, bread, plastic knives
- Algorithm writing templates
- Chart paper for successful algorithms
- Props for human robot activities
- Cleanup supplies and napkins
