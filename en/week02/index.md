# Week 2: Thinking Like a Computer

**Unit:** What is Computer Science? (Weeks 1-2)

## What's in Store This Week?

This week, we're going to learn the secret to talking to computers! It's all about thinking like they do. We'll discover that computers need super clear, step-by-step instructions to get anything done. These special instruction lists are called **algorithms**, and you use them every day without even realizing it! Through hilarious and hands-on games, you'll learn how to write your own algorithms and see why being super specific is the key to becoming a master programmer.

## What You'll Be Able to Do!

By the end of this week, you'll be able to:
- Explain what an "algorithm" is in your own words (it's like a recipe!).
- Write super clear, step-by-step instructions for everyday tasks.
- Find and fix problems in a set of instructions, a skill called "debugging."
- Understand why computers are a bit silly—they do *exactly* what you tell them, even if it's wrong!

## Lessons This Week

### [Lesson 2.1: How to Train Your Human Robot](lesson2.1.md)
**Get Ready To:** Become a programmer for a "human robot"! You'll give commands to your friends and see firsthand why every single step matters.

### [Lesson 2.2: The Great Peanut Butter Sandwich Challenge!](lesson2.2.md)
**Get Ready To:** Write the most detailed recipe ever for making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. We'll test your instructions live, and the results are guaranteed to be funny and educational!

## How We'll See Our Skills Grow

- **Teamwork in Action:** We'll see how well you work as a programmer-robot team.
- **Algorithm Check-Up:** We'll look at the instructions you write to see how clear and complete they are.
- **Before and After:** You'll get to improve your first set of instructions after seeing it in action, showing how much you've learned about debugging!

## Connecting to Other Subjects

- **Math:** You'll be using logic and putting things in the right order (sequencing).
- **Language Arts:** This is all about writing clear instructions that are easy to follow.
- **Life Skills:** You'll get better at following directions for anything, from building LEGOs to baking a cake.

## Real-World Connections

Did you know algorithms are everywhere? They're in:
- Cooking recipes
- GPS directions on a map
- Instructions for building a new toy
- The rules for your favorite board game

## Safety Considerations

- Food allergy awareness and alternatives
- Safe use of plastic utensils
- Proper cleanup procedures
- Hand sanitizer availability

## Materials Needed

- Peanut butter, jelly, bread, plastic knives
- Algorithm writing templates
- Chart paper for successful algorithms
- Props for human robot activities
- Cleanup supplies and napkins
