# Lesson 5.1: Loop-de-Loop Patterns

Welcome, pattern detectives and digital artists! Today, you'll discover the secret of loops—a programmer's best friend for repeating actions. We'll find patterns all around us and then use that inspiration to code beautiful, looping art.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this art session, you'll be able to:
- Spot repeating patterns in the world around you.
- Explain why using a "loop" is way more efficient (and easier!) than repeating code by hand.
- Use the "repeat" block to program your own visual patterns.
- Create amazing geometric art with code!

## Your Art Workshop Plan

### The Pattern Detective Hunt (15 minutes)
- Let's look at some amazing patterns in nature (like snowflakes and honeycombs) and in art. What parts repeat? How do they repeat?
- Now it's your turn to be the artist. Using blocks or shapes, let's create our own repeating patterns right here on our desks.
- We'll see how these real-world patterns are just like "loops" in programming.

### The Power of the Loop (15 minutes)
- Imagine you wanted a character to jump 10 times. You *could* use 10 jump blocks... or you could use ONE jump block inside a "repeat" loop!
- We'll show you how loops are the ultimate shortcut for programmers.
- Let's practice using the repeat block to make a sprite do a simple action over and over again.

### Programming Your Masterpiece (15 minutes)
- Time to create some geometric art! Using the repeat block, you can program amazing patterns.
- Play with color, shape, and movement. What happens if you repeat a turn? What if you repeat a "grow" or "shrink" block?
- The creative possibilities are infinite!

### The Art Gallery Walk (5 minutes)
- It's time to open our class art gallery! Let's display our amazing pattern creations.
- We'll walk around and admire each other's work, pointing out the cool repeating elements in each piece of art.
- Let's celebrate how everyone used the same tool—the loop—to create something totally unique!

## Your Artist's Toolkit
- Pictures of cool patterns to inspire us
- Blocks or other hands-on materials for making physical patterns
- Your device with Scratch Jr.
- Worksheets to help you sketch out your pattern ideas

## How to Become a Master Artist
- We'll see how well you can spot the repeating parts in our pattern hunt.
- Can you explain why a loop is a programmer's best shortcut?
- **The Masterpiece Test:** Your finished artwork will be a beautiful showcase of your ability to use repeat blocks to create complex patterns.

## New Tech Words to Master
- **Loop (or Repeat):** A command that tells your program to do the same action or set of actions over and over again.
- **Pattern:** A design or sequence that is repeated.
- **Efficient:** Getting a lot done with the least amount of work. Loops are super efficient!
- **Geometric:** Using shapes like squares, circles, and triangles to create a design.
