# Lesson 5.1: Loop-de-Loop Patterns

**Duration:** 50 minutes
**Format:** Pattern Exploration + Repetition Programming
**Unit:** Building Blocks of Programming (Week 3-5)

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Identify patterns in nature, art, and daily life
- Understand how loops make programming more efficient
- Create repeating visual patterns using programming
- Use repeat blocks effectively in their projects

## Lesson Structure

### Pattern Detective Hunt (15 minutes)
- Show examples of patterns from nature, architecture, art
- Students identify what repeats in each pattern
- Physical pattern creation with manipulatives
- Connect patterns to the concept of loops in programming

### Introduction to Programming Loops (15 minutes)
- Demonstrate inefficient vs. efficient programming
- Show how repeat blocks save time and space
- Practice with simple repeating movements
- Emphasize that loops are shortcuts for repetition

### Pattern Programming Workshop (15 minutes)
- Students create geometric patterns using repeat blocks
- Focus on color, shape, and movement patterns
- Encourage experimentation with different repeat numbers
- Allow creative freedom within pattern constraints

### Gallery Walk and Analysis (5 minutes)
- Display student patterns
- Identify the repeating elements in each creation
- Celebrate variety and creativity
- Discuss which patterns are most visually appealing and why

## Materials Needed
- Pattern examples (printed images or slides)
- Manipulatives for physical pattern creation (blocks, shapes)
- Devices with Scratch Jr.
- Pattern planning worksheets
- Gallery display method (projection or sharing)

## Assessment

### Formative
- Pattern recognition in examples
- Understanding of loop efficiency concept
- Successful use of repeat blocks
- Creativity and complexity of created patterns

## Art Integration
- Study famous artists who used patterns (Mondrian, Escher)
- Create physical patterns with art supplies
- Discuss how patterns create visual interest
- Connect to cultural patterns from around the world

## Math Connections
- Skip counting and multiplication concepts
- Geometric shape recognition
- Symmetry and transformation
- Basic algebraic thinking (pattern prediction)

## Extension Activities
- Create patterns that grow or change over time
- Program patterns inspired by different cultures
- Make interactive patterns that respond to touch
- Design patterns for younger students to continue

## Vocabulary Introduced
- Loop
- Repeat
- Pattern
- Efficient/Efficiency
- Geometric
