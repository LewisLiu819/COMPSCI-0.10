# Week 5: Loops and Patterns

**Unit:** Building Blocks of Programming (Weeks 3-5)
**Duration:** 2 lessons, 50 minutes each

## Week Overview

Week 5 concludes Unit 2 by introducing students to loops and repetition in programming. Through pattern exploration and creative projects, students learn how loops make programming more efficient and discover the mathematical and artistic beauty of repeating sequences.

## Learning Goals

By the end of Week 5, students will be able to:
- Identify patterns in nature, art, and daily life
- Understand how loops make programming more efficient
- Create visual and audio patterns using repeat blocks
- Collaborate effectively on programming projects

## Lessons This Week

### [Lesson 5.1: Loop-de-Loop Patterns](lesson5.1.md)
**Format:** Pattern Exploration + Repetition Programming

Students become pattern detectives, discovering repetition everywhere and learning to create geometric patterns using programming loops.

**Key Activities:**
- Pattern detective hunt in nature and art
- Comparison of efficient vs. inefficient programming
- Geometric pattern programming workshop
- Gallery walk and pattern analysis

**Vocabulary:** Loop, Repeat, Pattern, Efficient/Efficiency, Geometric

### [Lesson 5.2: Musical Loops and Sound Sequences](lesson5.2.md)
**Format:** Audio Programming + Creative Composition

Students create musical compositions using loops and sound sequences, combining programming with creative expression and collaborative work.

**Key Activities:**
- Musical pattern exploration and rhythm analysis
- Sound block investigation and experimentation
- Collaborative music creation in pairs
- Concert performance and sharing

**Vocabulary:** Rhythm, Sequence, Composition, Timing, Collaboration

## Assessment Highlights

- **Formative:** Pattern recognition skills, successful use of repeat blocks
- **Performance:** Musical composition creation and collaborative presentation
- **Portfolio:** Visual patterns and musical projects for growth documentation

## Cross-Curricular Connections

- **Art:** Visual patterns, famous pattern artists (Mondrian, Escher)
- **Music:** Rhythm, beat, and musical composition concepts
- **Math:** Skip counting, multiplication, symmetry, and geometric shapes
- **Cultural Studies:** Patterns from different cultures around the world

## Mathematical Connections

- Skip counting and multiplication concepts
- Geometric shape recognition and transformation
- Symmetry and mathematical patterns
- Basic algebraic thinking through pattern prediction

## Collaboration Skills Focus

- Taking turns and sharing ideas effectively
