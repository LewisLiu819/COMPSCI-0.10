# Week 5: The Power of Patterns and Loops!

**Unit:** Building Blocks of Programming (Weeks 3-5)

## What's in Store This Week?

This week, you'll unlock one of programming's biggest secrets: how to do a lot of work with very little code! We'll explore the world of **patterns** and **loops**, the tools programmers use to repeat actions over and over again. You'll become a pattern detective, finding loops in art, nature, and music. Then, you'll use this superpower to program amazing geometric art and compose your own looping music tracks. Get ready to make your programs more powerful and efficient!

## What You'll Be Able to Do!

By the end of this week, you'll be able to:
- Spot repeating patterns all around you.
- Explain how "loops" help programmers save a ton of time.
- Use the "repeat" block to create awesome visual and musical patterns.
- Team up with a partner to create a cool programming project.

## Lessons This Week

### [Lesson 5.1: Programming Infinite Patterns](lesson5.1/)
**Get Ready To:** Become a pattern detective and a digital artist! You'll hunt for patterns in the wild and then learn how to use loops to program mesmerizing, repeating geometric designs.

### [Lesson 5.2: Code Your Own Concert](lesson5.2/)
**Get Ready To:** Become a composer and a DJ! You'll learn how to loop sounds and notes to create your very own musical masterpieces and maybe even a catchy song!
