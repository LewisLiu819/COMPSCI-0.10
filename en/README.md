- **Technology**: Primarily uses Scratch Jr. for age-appropriate programming
- **Assessment**: Portfolio-based with formative and project-based summative assessments
- **Materials**: Minimal technology requirements, focus on creativity and exploration

## Archive Information

The previous lesson structure has been preserved in `lessons_archive/` for reference. The new structure provides:
- More detailed, age-appropriate content
- Better pedagogical progression
- Enhanced cross-curricular connections
- Comprehensive assessment strategies
- Clear learning objectives and outcomes

## Usage

To navigate the course:
1. Start with the main `index.md` for course overview
2. Choose a week from the navigation table
