# Lesson 4.2: Magic 8-Ball Fortune Teller

**Duration:** 50 minutes
**Format:** Project-Based Learning + Logic Programming
**Unit:** Building Blocks of Programming (Week 3-5)

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Program random responses to user input
- Understand how computers can simulate decision-making
- Create a complete interactive program from start to finish
- Debug programs that don't work as expected

## Lesson Structure

### Introduction to Randomness (10 minutes)
- Examine real Magic 8-Ball (if available) or show video
- Discuss how it creates different answers each time
- Brainstorm other examples of randomness in games and life
- Introduce the programming challenge

### Planning and Design (15 minutes)
- Students design their fortune teller appearance
- Choose 6-8 different responses (positive, negative, neutral)
- Plan the user interaction (touch to get fortune)
- Sketch their design on paper first

### Programming Implementation (20 minutes)
- Step-by-step programming of the Magic 8-Ball
- Use broadcast blocks for random responses
- Add visual and sound effects
- Teacher demonstrates, students follow with modifications

### Testing and Debugging (5 minutes)
- Students test their programs extensively
- Partner testing for feedback
- Fix any problems discovered
- Celebrate working programs

## Materials Needed
- Real Magic 8-Ball for demonstration (optional)
- Design planning sheets
- Devices with Scratch Jr.
- List of sample fortune responses
- Debugging checklist for students

## Assessment

### Formative
- Quality of planning and design
- Successful implementation of random responses
- Persistence in debugging
- Creativity in personalizing the project

### Summative
Completed, working Magic 8-Ball program that responds to user input with random messages.

## Math Connection
- Basic probability concepts
- Understanding of random vs. predictable
- Counting and organizing response options

## Extension Activities
- Add more sophisticated visual effects
- Create themed fortune tellers (sports, school, friendship)
- Program fortune tellers in different languages
- Create instruction cards for younger students

## Debugging Skills Focus
- Check connections between blocks
- Test individual parts of the program
- Compare working and non-working versions
- Ask for help when stuck

## Vocabulary Reinforced
- Random
- Broadcast
- Debug
- Test
- User input
