# Week 4: Giving Your Programs a Brain!

**Unit:** Building Blocks of Programming (Weeks 3-5)

## What's in Store This Week?

This week, we're giving our programs a superpower: the ability to make decisions! You'll learn the magic words of programming—**If... then...**—that let your creations respond to touch and make choices. We'll start by designing our own "Choose Your Own Adventure" stories and then build a mysterious "Magic 8-Ball" that can predict the future. Get ready to make your programs smarter and more interactive than ever before!

## What You'll Be Able to Do!

By the end of this week, you'll be able to:
- Use "if... then..." logic to solve problems and create stories.
- Make programs that do different things when you touch them.
- Use special "trigger" blocks to make your programs interactive.
- Build your very own interactive story with different paths and endings!

## Lessons This Week

### [Lesson 4.1: Choose Your Own Adventure!](lesson4.1/)
**Get Ready To:** Become an interactive storyteller! You'll learn how "if... then..." sentences work in the real world and then use that power to build a story in Scratch Jr. where the user gets to decide what happens next.

### [Lesson 4.2: Code a Mystic Magic 8-Ball](lesson4.2/)
**Get Ready To:** Create a fortune-telling program! You'll build your own Magic 8-Ball that gives a random, mysterious answer every time you ask it a question.

## How We'll See Our Skills Grow

- **Logic Check:** We'll see how you use "if... then..." logic in our games and in your programs.
- **Interactive Showcase:** You'll show off your adventure stories and explain the different choices a user can make.
- **The Final Project:** Your finished Magic 8-Ball will prove you can build a complete, interactive program from start to finish!

## Connecting to Other Subjects

- **Literature:** We'll explore how "Choose Your Own Adventure" books are structured, just like the programs we're building.
- **Math:** You'll learn about the basics of probability and what makes something "random."
- **Language Arts:** You'll practice creative writing by building your own branching stories.

## Your Programmer's Toolkit
- Tablets or computers with Scratch Jr.
- A few "Choose Your Own Adventure" books to inspire us
- Templates for planning your interactive stories
- A real Magic 8-Ball (or a video of one) to see how it works!

## Assessment Highlights

- **Formative:** Understanding of if-then logic, successful touch trigger implementation
- **Performance:** Interactive story creation and explanation of programming choices
- **Summative:** Complete Magic 8-Ball program with functional random responses

## Cross-Curricular Connections

- **Literature:** Story structure and choose-your-own-adventure narratives
- **Math:** Basic probability and random vs. predictable concepts
- **Science:** Logical reasoning and hypothesis testing
- **Language Arts:** Creative writing and storytelling

## Real-World Applications

- Traffic light systems and automated responses
- Thermostat operations and environmental controls
- Game mechanics and interactive entertainment
- Safety procedures and decision-making protocols

## Materials Needed

- Tablets or computers with Scratch Jr.
- Choose-your-own-adventure books for reference
- Story planning templates
- Magic 8-Ball (real or demonstration video)
- Design and project planning worksheets
