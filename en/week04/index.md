# Week 4: Conditionals and Interactive Programming

**Unit:** Building Blocks of Programming (Weeks 3-5)
**Duration:** 2 lessons, 50 minutes each

## Week Overview

Week 4 introduces students to conditional logic and interactive programming. Through choose-your-own-adventure stories and hands-on programming projects, students learn to create programs that make decisions based on user input and different conditions.

## Learning Goals

By the end of Week 4, students will be able to:
- Understand "if-then" logic in everyday situations and programming
- Create programs that respond to user interaction
- Use touch triggers and conditional statements in their projects
- Build interactive stories with multiple pathways

## Lessons This Week

### [Lesson 4.1: Choose Your Own Adventure - Introduction to Conditionals](lesson4.1.md)
**Format:** Interactive Storytelling + Programming Logic

Students explore if-then logic through real-world examples and create simple interactive stories using touch triggers and conditional statements.

**Key Activities:**
- If-then logic exploration with physical activities
- Interactive story planning and analysis
- Programming touch triggers and responses
- Creating simple branching narratives

**Vocabulary:** Conditional, If-then, Trigger, Interactive, Choice/Decision, Response

### [Lesson 4.2: Magic 8-Ball Fortune Teller](lesson4.2.md)
**Format:** Project-Based Learning + Logic Programming

Students create their own digital Magic 8-Ball fortune teller, learning to program random responses and complete interactive projects from start to finish.

**Key Activities:**
- Introduction to randomness and probability
- Project planning and design
- Programming random responses with broadcast blocks
- Testing, debugging, and project completion

**Vocabulary:** Random, Broadcast, Debug, Test, User input

## Assessment Highlights

- **Formative:** Understanding of if-then logic, successful touch trigger implementation
- **Performance:** Interactive story creation and explanation of programming choices
- **Summative:** Complete Magic 8-Ball program with functional random responses

## Cross-Curricular Connections

- **Literature:** Story structure and choose-your-own-adventure narratives
- **Math:** Basic probability and random vs. predictable concepts
- **Science:** Logical reasoning and hypothesis testing
- **Language Arts:** Creative writing and storytelling

## Real-World Applications

- Traffic light systems and automated responses
- Thermostat operations and environmental controls
- Game mechanics and interactive entertainment
- Safety procedures and decision-making protocols

## Materials Needed

- Tablets or computers with Scratch Jr.
- Choose-your-own-adventure books for reference
- Story planning templates
- Magic 8-Ball (real or demonstration video)
- Design and project planning worksheets
