# Lesson 4.1: Choose Your Own Adventure - Introduction to Conditionals

Welcome, storytellers! Today, you get to build a story that your friends can actually play. You'll learn the secret power of "if... then..." thinking, which lets you create choices and different paths in your very own interactive adventure.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this adventure, you'll be able to:
- Explain how "if... then..." sentences work in everyday life.
- Spot the "conditions" (the "if" part) and the "responses" (the "then" part) in a situation.
- Use "touch trigger" blocks to make your Scratch Jr. programs interactive.
- Create a simple story that has at least two different choices and endings.

## Your Adventure Plan

### The "If... Then..." Game (15 minutes)
- Let's start with the real world. For example: "**If** it starts raining, **then** I will open my umbrella."
- It's your turn! Let's brainstorm more "if... then..." examples from our daily lives. (If I'm hungry, then I get a snack!)
- We'll even act out some of these scenarios to see how choices lead to different actions.

### Story Planning Time (15 minutes)
- Let's look at a simple "Choose Your Own Adventure" story together.
- We'll map out the different choices and see how they lead to different endings.
- Now, it's your turn to be the author! You'll plan your own simple interactive story on paper. Think of a main character and two big choices they have to make.

### Programming the Magic Words (15 minutes)
- Time to bring your story to life in Scratch Jr.!
- We'll learn how to use the yellow "Trigger" blocks. The "Start on Tap" block is perfect for making choices!
- You'll program your sprites so that **if** a user taps them, **then** something cool happens.
- Let's experiment with different responses: maybe the sprite moves, says something, or even disappears!

### Test Your Story! (5 minutes)
- Time to start building your story.
- Find a partner and become a "play-tester." Try out each other's interactive stories. Do the choices work? Is it fun?
- Based on the feedback, you can debug and improve your adventure.

## Your Storyteller's Toolkit
- A few fun "Choose Your Own Adventure" books for inspiration
- Story planning worksheets to map out your ideas
- Your device with Scratch Jr.
- Big paper to write down all our "if... then..." examples

## How to Be a Master Storyteller
- We'll see how you come up with creative "if... then..." scenarios.
- Did you successfully plan a story with clear choices?
- **The Interactivity Test:** Your project will be a success if you can use touch triggers to make different things happen.

## New Tech Words to Master
- **Conditional:** A fancy word for an "if... then..." statement. It's code that only runs if a certain condition is met.
- **If... Then...:** The basic logic that computers use to make decisions.
- **Trigger:** An event that causes a script to start. Tapping on a sprite is a trigger!
- **Interactive:** A program that the user can control and play with.
- **Response:** The action that happens as a result of a trigger or a choice.
