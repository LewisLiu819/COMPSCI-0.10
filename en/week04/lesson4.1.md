# Lesson 4.1: Choose Your Own Adventure - Introduction to Conditionals

**Duration:** 50 minutes
**Format:** Interactive Storytelling + Programming Logic
**Unit:** Building Blocks of Programming (Week 3-5)

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Understand "if-then" logic in everyday situations
- Identify conditions and responses in simple scenarios
- Use touch triggers to create interactive programs
- Create a simple branching story with 2-3 choices

## Lesson Structure

### If-Then Logic Exploration (15 minutes)
- Start with real-world examples: "If it's raining, then I bring an umbrella"
- Students generate more if-then examples from daily life
- Physical activity: Act out if-then scenarios
- Connect to decision-making and choices

### Interactive Story Planning (15 minutes)
- Read a simple choose-your-own-adventure story together
- Analyze the decision points and outcomes
- Students plan their own simple interactive story
- Focus on one main character and 2-3 choices

### Programming Interactive Elements (15 minutes)
- Demonstrate touch triggers in Scratch Jr.
- Students program their sprites to respond to touch
- Practice making different things happen based on user interaction
- Experiment with different responses (movement, sound, costume changes)

### Story Creation and Testing (5 minutes)
- Begin creating interactive stories
- Partner testing - students try each other's programs
- Debugging and improvement based on testing

## Materials Needed
- Sample choose-your-own-adventure books
- Story planning templates
- Devices with Scratch Jr.
- Chart paper for if-then examples
- Story idea prompt cards for inspiration

## Assessment

### Formative
- Understanding demonstrated in if-then examples
- Quality of story planning
- Successful implementation of touch triggers
- Problem-solving during programming challenges

## Literature Connection
- Read classic choose-your-own-adventure stories
- Analyze story structure and decision points
- Connect literary choices to programming logic

## Real-World Applications
- Traffic light logic (if red, then stop)
- Thermostat operation (if cold, then heat)
- Game rules and consequences
- Safety procedures and responses

## Vocabulary Introduced
- Conditional
- If-then
- Trigger
- Interactive
- Choice/Decision
- Response
