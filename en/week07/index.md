# Week 7: Team Up and Troubleshoot!

**Unit:** Problem Solving and Logic (Weeks 6-8)
**Duration:** 2 lessons, 50 minutes each

## What's in Store This Week?

This week is all about becoming a super-powered problem-solver and an amazing teammate! First, you'll become a "Bug Buster" and learn the art of **debugging**—finding and fixing those pesky "bugs" that pop up in every programmer's code. You'll learn that making mistakes is a normal and even fun part of the journey. Then, you'll team up for a **Pair Programming** adventure, learning how two heads are better than one when it comes to creating awesome projects.

## What You'll Be Able to Do!

By the end of this week, you'll be able to:
- Find and fix common mistakes (bugs) in your programs like a pro.
- Use a step-by-step plan to figure out why your code isn't working.
- Work with a partner to build a program together.
- Feel confident and not give up when you face a tricky coding challenge.

## Lessons This Week

### [Lesson 7.1: Bug Busters! A Debugging Workshop](lesson7.1.md)
**Get Ready To:** Put on your detective gear and hunt for bugs! You'll learn that "bugs" are just puzzles to be solved and practice a secret four-step method for squashing any bug you find.

### [Lesson 7.2: Pair Programming Adventure!](lesson7.2.md)
**Get Ready To:** Team up with a partner for a coding mission! You'll learn the secrets of "pair programming" by taking turns as the "Driver" (at the controls) and the "Navigator" (the guide with the map).

## How We'll See Our Skills Grow

- **Bug Busting Skills:** We'll give you broken programs and see how you use the debugging steps to fix them.
- **Teamwork in Action:** We'll watch you and your partner work together. Are you sharing ideas? Are you communicating clearly?
- **Smarter Problem-Solving:** Your notes and discussions will show us how you're learning to think like a real programmer when you get stuck.

## Becoming a Great Teammate

This week is huge for learning important life skills, like:
- Taking turns and sharing your ideas.
