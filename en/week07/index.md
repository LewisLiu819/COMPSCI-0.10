# Week 7: Debugging and Pair Programming

**Unit:** Problem Solving and Logic (Weeks 6-8)
**Duration:** 2 lessons, 50 minutes each

## Week Overview

Week 7 focuses on essential programming skills: debugging and collaboration. Students learn systematic approaches to finding and fixing problems in their code, and experience the benefits of pair programming for creating better programs and learning from each other.

## Learning Goals

By the end of Week 7, students will be able to:
- Identify and fix common programming errors systematically
- Apply debugging strategies independently
- Work effectively with programming partners
- Demonstrate persistence when facing programming challenges

## Lessons This Week

### [Lesson 7.1: Bug Busters - Debugging Workshop](lesson7.1.md)
**Format:** Problem-Solving Skills + Systematic Debugging

Students learn that bugs are normal and expected in programming, and develop systematic strategies for finding and fixing problems in their code.

**Key Activities:**
- Introduction to bugs and debugging history
- Debugging strategy training (Stop, Look, Think, Try)
- Bug hunt challenge with intentionally broken programs
- Peer debugging support and collaboration

**Vocabulary:** Bug, Debugging, Systematic, Persistence, Troubleshooting
