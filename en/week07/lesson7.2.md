# Lesson 7.2: Pair Programming Partnership

Welcome, adventurers! Programming is often a team sport. Today, you'll partner up for a special mission, learning how to code together. This is called **Pair Programming**, and it's how many real-world programmers build amazing things!

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this adventure, you'll be able to:
- Work with a partner to build a program.
- Take turns in the two important roles: the "Driver" and the "Navigator."
- Clearly explain your coding ideas to a teammate.
- See how teamwork can make your programs even better!

## Your Co-Pilot Mission Plan

### Meet Your Co-Pilot (10 minutes)
- Let's learn the two secret roles! The **Driver** is the one with their hands on the controls (the tablet or computer). The **Navigator** is the guide, looking at the big picture, spotting problems, and giving directions.
- We'll do a quick demo to show you how a great Driver and Navigator work together.
- We'll agree on our team rules for being respectful and helpful partners.

### The Team Challenge (30 minutes)
- Time for your mission! You and your partner will work together to solve a series of programming challenges.
- We'll use a timer! Every few minutes, you'll hear a signal to **SWITCH ROLES**. This ensures everyone gets a turn to be the Driver and the Navigator.
- Your teacher will be your mission commander, visiting each team to help you work together smoothly.

### Mission Debrief (7 minutes)
- Back with your partner, have a quick chat: What worked well for your team? What was a little tricky?
- Let's share our best teamwork strategies with the whole class.
- We'll set a team goal for the next time we do pair programming.

### Celebrating Teamwork (3 minutes)
- Let's give a big cheer for all the amazing teamwork we saw today!
- We'll recognize that every person brings valuable ideas to the team.
- High-fives for your partner!

## Your Mission Gear
- One device with Scratch Jr. for each pair of adventurers
- Role cards to remind you if you're the Driver or the Navigator
- A timer for our role-switching signal
- A list of fun programming challenges for your team to conquer

## How to Be an All-Star Team
- We'll see how you and your partner talk to each other and share ideas.
- **Role Reversal:** How well do you switch between being the Driver and the Navigator?
- The amazing program you build together will be proof of your awesome teamwork!

## New Tech Words to Master
- **Pair Programming:** A style of coding where two people work together at one computer.
- **Driver:** The person who types the code or controls the mouse.
- **Navigator:** The person who watches, guides, and thinks about the big picture.
- **Collaboration:** A fancy word for teamwork!
- **Communication:** Sharing your ideas and listening to your partner's ideas clearly.
