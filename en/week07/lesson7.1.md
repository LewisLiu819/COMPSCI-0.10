# Lesson 7.1: Bug Busters - Debugging Workshop

**Duration:** 50 minutes
**Format:** Problem-Solving Skills + Systematic Debugging
**Unit:** Problem Solving and Logic (Week 6-8)

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Identify common programming errors systematically
- Apply debugging strategies independently
- Demonstrate persistence when facing programming challenges
- Help others debug their programs effectively

## Lesson Structure

### Introduction to Bugs and Debugging (12 minutes)
- Share the history of the term "bug" in computing (Grace Hopper story)
- Discuss how bugs are normal and expected in programming
- Introduce debugging as detective work
- Emphasize growth mindset: bugs are learning opportunities

### Debugging Strategy Training (18 minutes)
- Teach systematic debugging approach: Stop, Look, Think, Try
- Practice with intentionally broken programs
- Demonstrate reading code step-by-step
- Practice asking good debugging questions

### Bug Hunt Challenge (15 minutes)
- Students work with pre-made buggy programs
- Apply debugging strategies to fix various types of errors
- Categories: sequence errors, missing blocks, wrong parameters
- Celebrate successful fixes and learning from failures

### Peer Debugging Support (5 minutes)
- Students help classmates debug their own projects
- Practice giving helpful feedback without just fixing for others
- Develop vocabulary for describing programming problems

## Materials Needed
- Collection of intentionally buggy Scratch Jr. programs
- Debugging strategy posters and reference cards
- Devices with pre-loaded broken programs
- Debugging log sheets for tracking problem-solving
- Growth mindset posters and encouragement

## Assessment

### Formative
- Application of systematic debugging strategies
- Persistence and positive attitude toward challenges
- Quality of help provided to classmates
- Improvement in independent problem-solving

## Growth Mindset Focus
- Mistakes as learning opportunities
- Value of persistence and effort
- Celebrating progress and improvement
- Building confidence through successful problem-solving

## Real-World Problem-Solving Skills
- Systematic approach to any type of problem
- Breaking complex problems into smaller parts
- Testing solutions and learning from results
- Collaborative problem-solving and help-seeking

## Debugging Strategies Taught

### 1. Stop
Don't keep clicking randomly - pause and think

### 2. Look
Examine the code carefully and systematically

### 3. Think
What should happen vs. what is happening?

### 4. Try
Make one change at a time and test

## Extension Activities
- Create debugging challenges for other students
- Document common bugs and solutions
- Practice debugging in other areas (math problems, puzzles)
- Interview programmers about their debugging experiences

## Vocabulary Introduced
- Bug
- Debugging
- Systematic
- Persistence
- Troubleshooting
