# Lesson 7.1: Bug Busters - Debugging Workshop

Welcome, Bug Busters! Every programmer, from beginner to expert, runs into "bugs"—unexpected problems in their code. Today, you'll learn that bugs aren't scary; they're just puzzles waiting to be solved. Let's learn the secret strategies to squash any bug!

## What You'll Learn

By the end of your training, you'll be able to:
- Calmly identify when your program has a bug.
- Use a four-step secret strategy to find and fix bugs.
- Not give up when you face a tricky programming problem.
- Help your friends find and fix bugs in their code, too!

## Your Bug Busting Mission

### What's a "Bug"? (12 minutes)
- Let's learn the funny true story of the first-ever computer "bug" (it was a real moth!).
- We'll talk about how finding bugs is a normal, everyday part of being a programmer.
- Most importantly, we'll learn a programmer's most important belief: **Bugs are learning opportunities, not failures!**

### Secret Strategy Training (18 minutes)
- It's time to learn the secret four-step bug-squashing method: **Stop, Look, Think, Try.**
- We'll practice this method together on some programs that have obvious bugs.
- You'll learn how to read code one step at a time, just like a detective looking for clues.

### The Bug Hunt Challenge (15 minutes)
- Now it's your turn! We have some pre-made programs that are full of sneaky bugs.
- Your mission is to use the four-step strategy to find and fix different kinds of bugs (like blocks in the wrong order or missing pieces).
- Let's celebrate every bug we squash!

### Be a Bug Buddy! (5 minutes)
- Now, let's practice helping our friends.
- You'll get to look at a classmate's project and help them find a bug.
- Remember the Bug Buster rule: give helpful clues, don't just fix it for them!

## Your Bug Busting Toolkit
- A collection of Scratch Jr. programs with sneaky bugs hidden inside
- A poster of our secret **Stop, Look, Think, Try** strategy
- A "bug log" worksheet to keep track of the bugs you find and how you fixed them

## How to Become a Master Bug Buster
- We'll see you using the four-step strategy when you get stuck.
- **Persistence Power:** Do you keep trying even when a bug is tricky? That's the mark of a real programmer!
- How good are you at giving helpful clues to your Bug Buddy?

## The Secret Strategy:
- **1. Stop:** Take a breath! Don't just click everywhere.
- **2. Look:** Read your code carefully, one block at a time.
- **3. Think:** What did you EXPECT to happen? What is ACTUALLY happening?
- **4. Try:** Make ONE small change and test it again.

## New Tech Words to Master
- **Bug:** An error in a program that stops it from working the way you want.
- **Debugging:** The process of finding and fixing bugs. It's like being a detective for your code!
- **Systematic:** Having a step-by-step plan to solve a problem.
- **Persistence:** Not giving up, even when something is hard. It's a programmer's superpower!
