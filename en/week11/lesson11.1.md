# Lesson 11.1: Digital Art Gallery Programming

Welcome, digital artists! Today, you're not just going to draw a picture—you're going to create a piece of art that is alive. You'll use your coding skills to make interactive art that moves, changes, and responds to the viewer. Let's open our own digital art studio!

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this art class, you'll be able to:
- Use code to create a piece of digital art.
- Make your art interactive, so it responds when someone touches it.
- Explain how you used programming as your new favorite art supply.
- Combine the principles of art with the logic of code.

## Your Art Studio Plan

### What is Digital Art? (12 minutes)
- Let's look at some amazing examples of digital art. How did the artists use computers to create them?
- We'll brainstorm all the cool things we can do with our programming tools to make art. (Think: changing colors, repeating shapes, moving sprites).
- On paper, you'll sketch a simple idea for an interactive artwork you want to create.

### Creating Your "Living" Artwork (25 minutes)
- Time to bring your artistic vision to life!
- Your mission is to create a piece of digital art that has at least one interactive element.
- Ideas for your art:
  - A beautiful, repeating pattern that changes colors when you tap it.
  - A character that does a funny dance when you tap it.
  - A self-portrait where you can tap on your eyes to make them wink!
- This is your chance to experiment and be creative!

### Setting Up the Gallery (10 minutes)
- Every great artwork needs a title and a description! We'll learn how to write a simple "artist statement" that explains your piece.
- We'll get our projects ready for our class's "Living Art Gallery" walk.

### The Gallery Walk (3 minutes)
- It's time to admire the masterpieces!
- We'll walk around and explore each other's interactive art.
- Let's practice being a great audience by sharing one positive thing we like about each artwork.

## Your Artist's Toolkit
- Your device with Scratch Jr.
- Examples of cool digital art for inspiration
- Worksheets to help you plan your artwork and write your artist statement

## How to Be a Master Artist
- We'll look at your plan. How did you decide to combine art and code?
- **The Interactivity Test:** Does your artwork respond in a cool way when someone touches it?
- Your final creation will be a masterpiece that shows off both your artistic talent and your programming skills!

## New Tech Words to Master
- **Digital Art:** Art that is made using a computer.
- **Interactive Art:** Art that the viewer can play with or change in some way.
- **Artist Statement:** A short sentence where the artist explains what their art is about.
- **Creative Medium:** The material an artist uses. Your creative medium today is code!
