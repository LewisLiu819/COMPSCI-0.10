# Lesson 3.2: Making Characters Dance

Ready to turn up the music and get creative? Today, you're the choreographer of a digital dance party! You'll learn to combine movement, sound, and even loops to make your Scratch Jr. sprites perform amazing dance routines.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of the party, you'll be able to:
- String together a bunch of different motion blocks to create a dance sequence.
- Use the "repeat" block to make your dance moves loop like a chorus in a song.
- Add music and sound blocks to make your dance party come alive.
- Proudly share your amazing creations with your friends!

## Our Dance Party Plan

### Warm-up and Review (8 minutes)
- Let's do a quick refresh of our Scratch Jr. playground.
- Open up the project you saved last time and show us how you made your sprite move.
- Now, let's get ready for today's main event: the Dance Party Challenge!

### Planning Your Moves (12 minutes)
- First, let's brainstorm all the cool dance moves we can program. Think jumps, spins, and slides!
- On paper, you'll sketch out the sequence of your dance, like a real choreographer.
- We'll introduce two new powerful tools: the **repeat block** (to make moves happen over and over) and **sound blocks** (to add the music!).

### Let's Get Programming! (25 minutes)
- Time to bring your dance to life! Program the sequence you planned for your sprite.
- This is your chance to experiment! Try different moves, change the order, and see what happens.
- Don't forget to add music or cool sound effects to match your dance.

### Dance Performance Showcase (5 minutes)
- It's showtime! Volunteers can project their dance parties on the big screen for everyone to see.
- Let's cheer for our friends and give them positive feedback.
- Save your awesome projects—they are now part of your official programmer's portfolio!

## Your Party Supplies
- Your device with Scratch Jr. ready to go
- Worksheets for planning your dance choreography
- Some upbeat music playing in the classroom to get us inspired!
- A projector for our big showcase

## How to Be a Star Choreographer
- We'll see how creative you can get with your dance moves and sequences.
- **Star Power:** Did you successfully use a repeat block? Did you match the sound to the movement?
- **Performance Review:** You'll get to explain the cool programming choices you made for your dance.

## Go Further with Your Moves
- **Tell a Story:** Can your dance tell a simple story?
- **Dance Crew:** Can you program two or more sprites to dance together?
- **Costume Change:** Can you figure out how to make your sprite change its look during the dance?

## New Tech Words to Master
- **Sequence:** Putting a series of actions in a specific order to create a routine.
- **Repeat (or Loop):** A powerful command that tells the computer to do the same set of instructions over and over again.
- **Choreography:** The art of designing a dance—in our case, you're choreographing with code!
