- Use repeat blocks to create patterns
- Add sound blocks to enhance their programs
- Present their creative work to others

## Lesson Structure

### Warm-up and Review (8 minutes)
- Quick review of Scratch Jr. interface
- Students open previous projects and demonstrate movement
- Introduce today's creative challenge

### Dance Choreography Planning (12 minutes)
- Brainstorm dance moves that can be programmed
- Students sketch their dance sequence on paper first
- Introduce repeat blocks and sound blocks
- Demonstrate combining blocks for complex movements

### Programming Dance Party (25 minutes)
