# Lesson 3.1: Meet Scratch Jr. - Our Programming Playground

**Duration:** 50 minutes
**Format:** Technology Introduction + Guided Exploration
**Unit:** Building Blocks of Programming (Week 3-5)

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Navigate the Scratch Jr. interface confidently
- Identify and name basic programming blocks
- Create a simple sequence of 3-4 actions
- Explain what a "sprite" is in programming terms

## Lesson Structure

### Technology Setup (10 minutes)
- Distribute tablets/devices
- Practice proper device handling
- Log into Scratch Jr. accounts or start new projects
- Basic navigation review

### Guided Interface Tour (15 minutes)
- Teacher demonstrates on projector/large screen
- Students follow along on their devices
- Identify key areas: stage, sprites, block palette, script area
- Practice selecting and dragging blocks

### First Programming Experience (20 minutes)
- Challenge: Make your sprite move across the screen
- Students experiment with motion blocks
- Encourage trial and error exploration
- Teacher circulates providing individual support

### Sharing and Celebration (5 minutes)
- Quick gallery walk to see classmates' projects
- Students share one discovery or challenge
- Save projects for next lesson

## Materials Needed
- Tablets or computers with Scratch Jr. installed
- Projector/large screen for demonstrations
- Student device management system (numbers, charging station)
- Quick reference cards with basic blocks
- Success celebration stickers or stamps

## Assessment

### Formative
- Observation of interface navigation skills
- Ability to drag and connect blocks
- Problem-solving persistence during exploration

### Quick Check
Students demonstrate how to make their sprite move and explain which block they used.

## Differentiation
- **Advanced learners:** Challenge to use multiple different motion blocks
- **Struggling learners:** Pair with tech-savvy classmate, provide visual step-by-step cards
- **Fine motor challenges:** Adjust device settings for easier touch response

## Technology Troubleshooting Tips
- Prepare backup activities for technology failures
- Have student tech helpers identified
- Know basic restart/reset procedures
- Keep written instructions simple and visual

## Vocabulary Introduced
- Sprite
- Block
- Script
- Stage
- Drag
- Programming
