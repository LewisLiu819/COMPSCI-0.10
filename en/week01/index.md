# Week 1: Welcome to the Digital World

**Unit:** What is Computer Science? (Weeks 1-2)

## What's in Store This Week?

Welcome to the first week of your computer science adventure! We're going to kick things off by becoming "Computer Detectives." You'll discover that computers aren't just the boxes on our desks—they are hiding everywhere in plain sight! Through fun games and activities, you'll learn the secret language of computers (input, processing, and output) and get comfortable using classroom technology. Get ready to explore, discover, and start your journey to becoming a tech whiz!

## What You'll Be Able to Do!

By the end of this week, you'll be able to:
- Point out at least 5 different types of computers around you.
- Explain in your own words what a computer is and how it helps us every day.
- Group different computers based on what they do.
- Understand the three secret steps all computers follow: **Input → Processing → Output**.
- Feel confident using a tablet or computer.
- Know how to handle our classroom gadgets with care.
