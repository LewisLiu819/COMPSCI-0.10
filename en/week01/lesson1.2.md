# Lesson 1.2: Computers Are Everywhere!

**Duration:** 50 minutes
**Format:** Investigation + Digital Exploration
**Unit:** What is Computer Science? (Week 1-2)

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Categorize different types of computers by their functions
- Explain how computers process information (input → processing → output)
- Identify inputs and outputs for common devices
- Navigate basic tablet/computer interface

## Lesson Structure

### Review and Share (10 minutes)
- Students share family computer hunt discoveries
- Add new findings to class computer chart
- Celebrate diverse discoveries

### Input-Output Investigation (20 minutes)
- Demonstrate input-output concept with classroom examples
- Students work in small groups to identify inputs/outputs for different devices
- Physical demonstration: students act as computers processing information
- Create input-output cards for matching game

### Digital Exploration Time (15 minutes)
- Introduction to classroom tablets/computers
- Practice turning on devices, basic navigation
- Explore pre-loaded educational apps briefly
- Focus on observation rather than extensive use

### Wrap-up and Reflection (5 minutes)
- Quick sharing: "One new thing I learned about computers"
- Preview of next lesson's exciting activities

## Materials Needed
- Tablets or computers for student use
- Input-output investigation worksheets
- Device cards for matching activity
- Chart paper for ongoing class discoveries
- Simple props for human computer demonstration

## Assessment

### Formative
- Input-output matching activity completion
- Observation of device handling and navigation
- Quality of explanations during investigations

### Summative
Simple quiz with pictures - students identify inputs and outputs for 3 common devices.

## Differentiation
- **Advanced learners:** Challenge to find unusual input-output examples
- **Struggling learners:** Provide pre-made input-output cards for reference
- **ELL students:** Use visual cards with minimal text, pair with bilingual buddy

## Extension Activities
- Create input-output diagrams for devices at home
- Interview family members about how they use computers for work
- Start a class "Amazing Computer Facts" collection

## Vocabulary Reinforced/Introduced
- Input
- Output
- Processing
- Interface
- Navigate
