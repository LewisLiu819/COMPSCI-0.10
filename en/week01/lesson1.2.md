# Lesson 1.2: Computers Are Everywhere!

Now that you're an expert computer detective, let's dive deeper! In this lesson, we'll investigate the secret behind how all computers "think" and work.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of today's investigation, you will be able to:
- Sort different computers into groups based on their jobs.
- Explain the secret three-step process all computers use: **Input → Processing → Output**.
- Point out the "inputs" and "outputs" for everyday devices.
- Feel comfortable finding your way around a tablet or computer.

## Our Investigation Plan

### Review and Share (10 minutes)
- Let's hear about your computer discoveries from the "Family Computer Hunt" you did at home!
- We'll add all your new finds to our giant class computer chart.
- It's a celebration of all the amazing and different computers you found!

### The Secret of Input-Output (20 minutes)
- We'll uncover the "input-processing-output" secret with fun examples.
- In small groups, you'll become investigators, figuring out the inputs and outputs for different gadgets.
- **Get ready to be a human computer!** We'll do a fun activity where you act out the steps to process information.

### Digital Explorer Time (15 minutes)
- Time to get hands-on with the classroom tablets and computers!
- We'll practice turning them on and navigating the basics.

## New Tech Words to Master
- **Input:** Any information you give to a computer (like clicking a mouse, typing on a keyboard, or speaking to a smart speaker).
- **Output:** The way a computer gives you information back (like showing something on a screen, playing a sound, or printing a page).
- **Processing:** The computer's "brain" thinking about the input to create an output.
- **Interface:** The screen and buttons you use to interact with a device.
- **Navigate:** Finding your way around a website or a computer's screen.
