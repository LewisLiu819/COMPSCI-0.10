# Lesson 9.1: Digital Storytelling - Adapting Fairy Tales

Welcome, digital directors! Today, you'll take a classic story and become the director of its brand-new animated movie. We'll learn the secret of all great stories—the three-part structure—and use it to plan and build our own digital fairy tales.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to:
- Break down a story into its three main parts: beginning, middle, and end.
- Plan your own three-scene story using a storyboard.
- Program a story with different scenes that connect to each other.
- Combine your amazing programming skills with your creativity as a storyteller.

## Your Director's Plan

### The Secret of a Great Story (15 minutes)
- Let's look at a classic fairy tale, like "The Three Little Pigs." We'll find the three main parts:
  - **The Beginning:** We meet the characters and learn the setting.
  - **The Middle:** The characters face a problem or go on an adventure.
  - **The End:** The problem is solved!
- We'll choose a simple fairy tale to adapt for our project. The goal is to retell it in three simple scenes.

### Your Director's Storyboard (15 minutes)
- Every great director uses a storyboard to plan their movie. It's like a comic strip that shows what will happen in each scene.
- On your storyboard template, you'll sketch out your three scenes:
  - **Scene 1 (Beginning):** Who are your characters? Where are they?
  - **Scene 2 (Middle):** What is the main action or problem?
  - **Scene 3 (End):** How does it all wrap up?
- Think about how your characters will move and how you'll switch from one scene to the next.

### Lights, Camera, Action! (15 minutes)
- Time to start programming your story in Scratch Jr.!
- Your first goal is to build your three scenes and add your characters.
- Program the main action for each scene and think about how to make your characters move.
- We'll learn how to make the story automatically go from scene 1 to scene 2, and then to scene 3.

### Sneak Peek! (5 minutes)
- Let's share the first scene of our stories.
- Get some feedback from your friends. Does it look interesting? Do they want to see what happens next?

## Your Director's Toolkit
- A few simple fairy tale books to choose from
- Storyboard templates for planning your three scenes
- Your device with Scratch Jr.

## How to Be a Great Director
- Your storyboard will show how well you can plan a simple, three-part story.
- **The Scene Test:** Can you successfully create three different scenes and make them connect in the right order?
- Your creativity in retelling a classic story in your own style is what will make it shine!

## New Tech Words to Master
- **Adaptation:** Taking an existing story and changing it to fit a new style (like turning a book into a movie!).
- **Storyboard:** A series of drawings that shows the plan for each scene in a movie or animation.
- **Scene Transition:** The way you move from one scene to the next.
- **Narrative Structure:** The basic plan of a story (for us, it's a beginning, middle, and end).
