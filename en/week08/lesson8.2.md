# Lesson 8.2: Digital Scrapbook Creation

Welcome, creators! It's time to bring everything you've learned together into one amazing project: a digital scrapbook that is all about YOU. This is your chance to use your programming superpowers to tell your own story and show off your unique personality.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this project, you'll be able to:
- Plan and organize a multi-page digital project.
- Combine pictures, words, and interactive buttons to create a cool multimedia experience.
- Use your coding skills to express who you are.
- Feel proud of a big project that you planned and built yourself!

## Your Creation Plan

### Planning Your "About Me" Scrapbook (15 minutes)
- Let's brainstorm! What makes you, YOU? What pages should go in your scrapbook? (Ideas: My Family, My Hobbies, My Favorite Things, My Goals).
- You'll be the designer. On paper, sketch out the different pages and think about how a user will navigate between them.
- Who is this scrapbook for? (Maybe for your family, or for your friends to get to know you better!)

### Build Your Masterpiece! (30 minutes)
- Time to bring your plan to life in Scratch Jr.!
- Your main goal is to create a scrapbook with different "pages" (scenes) that users can explore.
- Add your personal information, your favorite things, and anything else that tells your story.
- Make it interactive! Use buttons that, when tapped, take the user to a different page or reveal a secret message.

### The Grand Showcase (5 minutes)
- Let's explore each other's amazing scrapbooks!
- As you look at a partner's project, give them a compliment and ask a question about their creation.
- Let's celebrate all the unique and creative ways we told our own stories with code.

## Your Creator's Toolkit
- Planning worksheets to help you design your scrapbook layout
- Your device with Scratch Jr.
- Idea cards with prompts about your favorite things to get you started
- A respectful and curious attitude for our Grand Showcase!

## How to Make an Awesome Scrapbook
- We'll look at your plan. Is it well-organized with clear ideas for each page?
- **The Navigation Test:** Can a friend easily find their way through the different pages of your scrapbook?
- Your finished project will be an amazing showcase of your creativity and all the programming skills you've learned!

## New Tech Words to Master
- **Navigation:** How a user moves around your project, from one page or scene to another.
- **Multimedia:** A project that combines different types of media, like text, pictures, and interactive buttons.
- **Digital Identity:** All the things that make you unique, shared in a digital way. This scrapbook is a part of your digital identity!
