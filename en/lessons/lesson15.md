## Lesson 15: Capstone Project: Technology and Innovation

### Learning Objectives
1.  **Apply learned knowledge to complete a comprehensive project**: Allow students to integrate the knowledge of programming, robotics, artificial intelligence, big data, and multimedia programming learned in previous courses into a practical project.
2.  **Cultivate innovation and problem-solving skills**: Encourage students to independently design technology projects, exercising their ability to analyze, plan, and implement creative ideas.
3.  **Enhance teamwork and communication skills**: By completing projects in group collaborations, students will learn to divide tasks, cooperate, and communicate effectively, experiencing the fun and challenges of teamwork.

### Project Requirements

1.  **Project Theme**: Centered around "Technology and Innovation," choose a real-world problem or scenario and design a technology project to solve or improve it. The project can be an application, a smart device, or an interactive experience.
2.  **Project Content**: The project should include at least the following elements:
    *   **Programming Logic**: Implement the core functionality of the program using sequential, loop, and conditional statements.
    *   **Multimedia Presentation**: Incorporate multimedia elements such as images, sound, and animation to enhance visual and interactive effects.
    *   **Innovative Application**: Combine content related to robotics, artificial intelligence, or big data to increase the project's practicality or fun.

### Project Steps

#### 1. Project Planning and Conception (Phase 1: 1-2 class periods)
*   **Brainstorming**: Students discuss project ideas in groups. Guide them to think about how to use technology to solve real-life problems.
*   **Topic Selection**: Each group selects a specific theme, such as a "smart home assistant," a "study-buddy robot," or a "health tracking app," and clarifies the project's goals and main functions.
*   **Functional Design**: Students work together to list the main functions and technical requirements for the project.

#### 2. Project Development and Implementation (Phase 2: 3-4 class periods)
*   **Programming Implementation**: Group members write the code for the project according to their assigned tasks, completing the implementation of basic functions. Use visual programming tools or robotics programming platforms to build the core logic.
*   **Adding Multimedia**: Add multimedia elements like images, sound effects, and animations to enhance the project's user experience.
*   **Function Debugging**: Test and adjust the various functions of the project to ensure correct logic and smooth presentation of effects.

#### 3. Project Showcase and Optimization (Phase 3: 1-2 class periods)
*   **Project Demonstration**: Each group presents their project, demonstrating its functions to the class and teacher, and explaining the design concepts and technical implementation process.
*   **Feedback and Improvement**: Students and the teacher provide feedback, and each group optimizes and makes detailed adjustments to their project based on the feedback.
*   **Final Showcase**: Finally, each group's project results are displayed, sharing creative ideas and solutions. Outstanding teams are recognized, and the project experience is summarized.

### Project Examples

1.  **Smart Garbage Sorting Assistant**: Design an AI assistant that can identify different types of trash to help users sort their garbage. The project can utilize image recognition, conditional statements, etc.
2.  **Study Buddy Robot**: A robot that helps with revision by asking questions based on set knowledge points and giving encouragement when the student answers correctly. The project can combine robotics programming with loops and conditional statements.
3.  **Health Management App**: Develop a simple health tracking app that records daily steps and water intake and generates a report through data analysis. The project can combine big data and multimedia presentation.

### Teaching Resources
*   **Programming Tools**: Such as Scratch or educational robotics programming platforms, to facilitate students' project implementation.
*   **Multimedia Asset Library**: Provide images, sound effects, and animation assets for students to use in their projects.
*   **Learning References**: Provide some real-world project case studies and resource libraries for students to refer to, sparking their creativity.

### After-Class Activity
*   **Project Summary and Reflection**: Have students reflect on what they gained from the project, and document the challenges and their problem-solving approaches.
*   **Showcase and Promotion**: Organize an event for parents or other classes to view the students' project results, increasing the students' sense of achievement and stimulating their interest in learning.
