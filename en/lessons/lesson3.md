## Lesson 3: Programs and Algorithms

### Learning Objectives
1.  **Understand the basic concepts of "program" and "algorithm"**: Help students understand that a program is a series of instructions, while an algorithm is a step-by-step method for solving a problem.
2.  **Learn simple program logic**: Through interactions and small games, students will be able to write a simple set of instructions to achieve a specific goal.
3.  **Develop problem-solving skills**: By designing and optimizing algorithms for small tasks, students will exercise their logical thinking and innovation abilities.

### Course Outline

#### 1. Introduction (10 minutes)
*   **Real-life Introduction**: Ask students: "If you were to teach a robot how to brush its teeth, what steps would you tell it to follow?" Use this example to introduce the concepts of "program" and "algorithm."
*   **Initial Definition**: Explain that a program is a collection of instructions, while an algorithm is the step-by-step process of solving a problem. Simply put, a program tells the computer "what to do," while an algorithm tells the computer "how to solve the problem."

#### 2. Main Content (25 minutes)
1.  **What is a Program?** (10 minutes)
    *   **Basic Components of a Program**: Explain in simple terms that a program contains instructions that are executed in sequence.
    *   **Mini-Game: Instruction Relay**: Divide students into groups. Each group needs to give instructions to a "robot" (which can be played by a student) to complete a task, such as walking to a specific location in the classroom. Through this game, students experience writing and executing instructions.

2.  **What is an Algorithm?** (10 minutes)
    *   **The Meaning of an Algorithm**: Use familiar examples (like how to fold paper or clean a room) to explain that an algorithm is a step-by-step method for solving a problem.
    *   **Optimizing an Algorithm**: Present a simple problem, such as "how to find the largest number in a pile of numbers," and guide students to design different methods and discuss which one is simpler and faster.

3.  **The Relationship Between Algorithms and Programs** (5 minutes)
    *   **Summary**: An algorithm is the core of a program. Every program contains one or more algorithms to accomplish different tasks.
    *   **Analogy**: A program can be compared to a complete recipe, while an algorithm is the specific steps in the recipe. This helps students understand that an algorithm is part of a program, but a program may contain multiple algorithms.

#### 3. Interactive Session: Design Your Own Program and Algorithm (10 minutes)
*   **Activity Description**: Have students work in groups to design a simple program, such as making a "robot" navigate a maze within a specified number of steps. They need to write a set of instructions and design a reasonable algorithm to ensure the "robot" can complete the task accurately.
*   **Sharing and Discussion**: Each group presents their solution, encouraging peer learning and feedback among students.

#### 4. Conclusion and Q&A (5 minutes)
*   **Summary of Course Content**: Review the basic concepts of programs and algorithms and their relationship. Encourage students to think about how to use steps and logic to solve problems in their daily lives.
*   **Q&A Session**: Answer students' questions and encourage them to observe examples of programs and algorithms in their daily lives after class.

### Teaching Resources
*   **Robot Prop**: A toy robot or a student playing the role can be used to help students experience the process of writing instructions.
*   **Whiteboard and Markers**: To draw the path for the instruction relay game and the maze task.
*   **Learning Cards**: Design small examples of programs and algorithms for students to practice after class.

### After-Class Activity
*   **Home Task**: Have students try to write a "morning routine program," listing the steps they think are reasonable.
*   **Thinking Task**: Ask students to think about and record which life scenarios could be completed more efficiently using an "algorithm" and be prepared to share in the next class.
