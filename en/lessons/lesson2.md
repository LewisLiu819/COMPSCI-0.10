## Lesson 2: History and Impact of Computers

### Learning Objectives
1.  **Understand the history of computer development**: Through vivid stories and pictures, students will be able to understand the evolution of computers from early calculating tools to modern computers.
2.  **Recognize the impact of computers on society**: Help students understand how the application of computers in various fields has changed human life.
3.  **Stimulate students' interest in exploring history**: Through interactive activities, guide students to think about the changes in life brought about by technological progress and stimulate their curiosity about technological development.

### Course Outline

#### 1. Introduction (10 minutes)
*   **Guiding Question**: Ask students: "When do you think the computer was invented? What did it look like?" and let them make bold guesses.
*   **Brief Discussion**: Students share their ideas, and then the teacher introduces where the history of computers will begin.

#### 2. Main Content (25 minutes)
1.  **Origin and Development of Computers** (10 minutes)
    *   **The Birth of Computing Tools**: Tell stories of ancient counting tools such as the abacus and mechanical calculators to help students understand the earliest "computers".
    *   **The First Modern Computer**: Show a picture of the world's first computer, ENIAC, and explain its huge size and limited functions to help students appreciate the progress of technology.

2.  **Key Milestones in Computer Development** (10 minutes)
    *   **Important Inventions**: Briefly introduce some milestone computer inventions, such as the transistor, integrated circuit, and the birth of the personal computer (PC).
    *   **The Speed of Technological Progress**: Show the evolution of computers from tens of square meters to small PCs, then to laptops and smartphones, and guide students to think about why computers are getting smaller and smaller.

3.  **Impact of Computers on Daily Life** (5 minutes)
    *   **Case Studies**: Show the role of computers in daily life through specific examples, such as helping doctors with diagnoses, students with learning, and families with entertainment, to help students understand the wide range of computer applications.

#### 3. Interactive Session: Imagining the Computers of the Future (10 minutes)
*   **Brainstorming**: Have students discuss in groups and imagine what future computers will be like, for example, whether they will be more intelligent, more portable, or more user-friendly.
*   **Sharing and Discussion**: Encourage students to share their ideas, cultivate their imagination for the future of technology, and discuss with them the possibilities and challenges brought by technological progress.

#### 4. Conclusion and Q&A (5 minutes)
*   **Summary of Key Points**: Review the history of computer development and the impact of computers on daily life.
*   **Q&A Session**: Answer students' questions and encourage them to go home and share the stories of computer history they learned today with their families.

### Teaching Resources
*   **Pictures and Videos**: Show a comparison of early computers (such as ENIAC), modern laptops, smartphones, etc.
*   **Props**: If possible, prepare an abacus or a small mechanical calculator to give students a hands-on experience.
*   **Whiteboard or Interactive Screen**: For displaying the historical timeline.

### After-Class Activity
*   **Discussion Task**: Encourage students to think about what life would be like without computers and share their answers in the next class.
