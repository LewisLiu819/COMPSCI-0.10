## Lesson 8: Functions and Modularity

### Learning Objectives
1.  **Understand the basic concept of functions**: Help students understand the definition and purpose of functions and how they can be used to achieve code reusability.
2.  **Master the basic idea of modular programming**: Students will gain a preliminary understanding of the advantages of modular programming and use simple functions to organize their code.
3.  **Cultivate structured programming thinking**: By breaking down tasks and encapsulating them into functions, students will enhance their logical thinking and problem-solving abilities.

### Course Outline

#### 1. Introduction (10 minutes)
*   **Introducing the Topic**: Ask students: "If you want to make a character jump and turn repeatedly, is there a way to do it without writing the same code over and over again?" This will lead to the concept of functions.
*   **Preliminary Introduction**: Explain that a function is a reusable block of code that can be "called" to execute the same set of instructions. Use analogies from daily life, such as a "recipe" or "instruction manual," to help students understand the concept of functions.

#### 2. Main Content (25 minutes)
1.  **What is a Function?** (10 minutes)
    *   **Definition of a Function**: Introduce a function as a named block of code that can be called multiple times when needed, reducing code repetition.
    *   **Purpose of a Function**: Demonstrate with an example, such as a "jump" function, which allows a character to "jump" at any time in the program without having to write the same code each time.
    *   **Function Input and Output**: Briefly introduce that a function can accept input (parameters) and return a result (output), for example, controlling the height of a character's jump by inputting a "jump height."

2.  **Creating and Calling Functions** (10 minutes)
    *   **Demonstrating Function Creation**: Show how to create a function (or use a custom code block) in a visual programming platform.
    *   **Calling a Function**: Have students try calling the functions they have defined and observe how functions help simplify their operations. For example, design a "move and jump" function combination and call it repeatedly to achieve continuous actions.

3.  **The Concept of Modular Programming** (5 minutes)
    *   **What is Modularity?**: Introduce modular programming as a method of organizing a program by breaking down the code into multiple independent functions, making the code structure clearer and easier to maintain.
    *   **Benefits of Modularity**: Help students understand that modularity makes a program easier to understand and modify, especially as the program becomes more complex.

#### 3. Comprehensive Practice: Creating a Step-by-Step Task Project (10 minutes)
*   **Project Description**: Have students design a small project, such as a "moving and jumping game" for a character, by writing multiple functions to implement the character's various actions.
*   **Group Practice**: Students work in groups, trying to break down complex actions into different function modules and calling these modules in their program, experiencing the benefits of modular programming.

#### 4. Conclusion and Q&A (5 minutes)
*   **Review of Key Points**: Summarize the concepts of functions and modularity and their importance in programming.
*   **Q&A Session**: Answer students' questions and encourage them to use functions in their own projects after class to simplify their code.

### Teaching Resources
*   **Visual Programming Platform**: Such as Scratch, used to demonstrate function and modularity operations.
*   **Sample Code**: Prepare some simple function examples to help students understand how to define and call functions.

### After-Class Activity
*   **Hands-on Task**: Have students design a small project in Scratch that includes at least two functions, such as a "jump and turn" mini-game.
*   **Thinking Task**: Have students think about which tasks in their daily lives can be modularized (such as the steps for cooking, exercising, etc.) and share them in the next class.
