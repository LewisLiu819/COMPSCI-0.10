## Lesson 6: Variables and Data

### Learning Objectives
1.  **Understand the concepts of sequence, loops, and conditional statements**: To help students understand the basic elements of program control structures.
2.  **Master basic control structures in visual programming**: Students will be able to apply sequence, loops, and conditional statements in visual programming to complete simple programming tasks.
3.  **Develop logical thinking and problem-solving skills**: By writing programs, students will gradually learn to plan steps and optimize processes.

### Course Outline

#### 1. Introduction (10 minutes)
*   **Introducing the Topic**: Ask students: "If you want a robot to dance, what steps does it need to follow?" This will lead to the introduction of the concepts of "sequence," "loops," and "conditions."
*   **Preliminary Introduction**: The teacher briefly explains the meaning of these three program structures:
    *   **Sequence**: Executing instructions in order.
    *   **Loop**: Repeating the same instructions.
    *   **Condition**: Executing different instructions based on different situations.

#### 2. Main Content (25 minutes)
1.  **Sequential Structure** (5 minutes)
    *   **Concept Explanation**: Explain that a sequential structure executes each instruction in order.
    *   **Example Demonstration**: Use visual programming to demonstrate a simple example where a character moves, turns, and speaks in sequence.
    *   **Practice**: Have students write a simple sequential program, such as making a character move in four directions in order.

2.  **Loop Structure** (10 minutes)
    *   **Concept Explanation**: Explain that a loop is used to repeat a piece of code, which can reduce repetitive work.
    *   **Types of Loops**: Demonstrate two common types of loops in visual programming:
        *   **Fixed-count loop**: Sets a specific number of repetitions, such as "repeat 10 times."
        *   **Infinite loop**: Repeats continuously until a certain stop condition is met.
    *   **Mini-Game: Robot Walks in a Square**: Have students design a simple loop that makes a character automatically walk in a square. Students can set different numbers of repetitions to observe the effects.

3.  **Conditional Statements** (10 minutes)
    *   **Concept Explanation**: Conditional statements choose to execute different instructions based on a "true" or "false" condition.
    *   **Example Demonstration**: Use visual programming to show a conditional statement, for example, "if touching the edge, then turn."
    *   **Mini-Task: Writing a Conditional Statement**: Have students design a simple program that makes a character change direction or react when it encounters a specific situation (such as touching another character or the edge).

#### 3. Comprehensive Practice: Creating a Small Interactive Game (10 minutes)
*   **Project Introduction**: Have students use sequence, loops, and conditional statements to create an interactive mini-game, such as a "chase game" where one character continuously chases another.
*   **Group Activity**: Students work in groups to design the mini-game, reinforcing their understanding of sequence, loops, and conditions, and exercising their teamwork and creativity.

#### 4. Conclusion and Q&A (5 minutes)
*   **Review of Key Points**: Summarize the concepts of sequence, loops, and conditional statements, emphasizing their importance in programming.
*   **Q&A Session**: Answer students' questions and encourage them to try more creative projects using these three structures after class.

### Teaching Resources
*   **Visual Programming Platform**: Tools like Scratch allow students to visually understand sequence, loops, and conditions.
*   **Videos and Pictures**: Show real-life applications of loops and conditions, such as the changing of traffic lights, to help students understand abstract concepts.

### After-Class Activity
*   **Hands-on Task**: Have students design a simple animation or mini-game in Scratch, using sequence, loops, and conditional statements as much as possible.
*   **Thinking Task**: Encourage students to observe examples of loops and conditions in their daily lives and share their findings in the next class.
