## Lesson 11: Computer Networks and the Internet

### Learning Objectives
1.  **Understand the basic concepts of computer networks**: Help students understand the components of a computer network and how networks allow computers to connect and communicate with each other.
2.  **Recognize the structure and applications of the Internet**: Introduce the basic structure and common applications of the Internet to help students understand its importance in daily life.
3.  **Cultivate network security awareness**: Gain a preliminary understanding of the importance of network security and learn how to protect personal privacy and information security.

### Course Outline

#### 1. Introduction (10 minutes)
*   **Introducing the Topic**: Ask students: "Do you know how your phone connects to the internet? How do computers 'talk' to each other?" This will guide students to think about how computer networks connect.
*   **Preliminary Introduction**: Briefly explain that a computer network is a system of multiple devices connected to each other to help them exchange information. Further explain the different types of networks (such as local networks and the Internet).

#### 2. Main Content (25 minutes)
1.  **Basic Components of a Computer Network** (10 minutes)
    *   **Network Components**: Introduce the core components of a network, including computers, routers, switches, etc.
    *   **How Networks Communicate**: Use a simple analogy to explain how data is transmitted over a network. For example, data can be compared to a letter that is passed between devices by a "mail carrier" called a "router."
    *   **Local Networks and the Internet**: Explain the difference between a small local network and the global Internet, helping students understand how to access broader Internet resources through a local network.

2.  **Structure and Common Applications of the Internet** (10 minutes)
    *   **Internet Structure**: Introduce the Internet as a global collection of computer networks. Briefly describe how the Internet works, such as how web pages are retrieved from a server by a browser.
    *   **Common Internet Applications**: Show the Internet applications that students use daily, such as social media, email, video calls, etc., to help them understand the versatility and convenience of the Internet.

3.  **Basics of Network Security** (5 minutes)
    *   **The Need for Safe Internet Use**: Briefly introduce the importance of network security, so students understand the need to protect personal information and avoid clicking on unknown links.
    *   **Basic Network Security Tips**: Such as setting strong passwords and not disclosing personal information, to help students develop safe online habits.

#### 3. Interactive Session: Simulating Network Communication (10 minutes)
*   **Simulation Activity**: In groups, simulate the process of network communication. Each group plays the role of a different network device (such as a computer, router, or server) and demonstrates the path of data transmission in a network by "passing information."
*   **Group Discussion**: Students discuss the necessity of network security in groups and share their awareness and experiences with network security in their daily lives.

#### 4. Conclusion and Q&A (5 minutes)
*   **Review of Key Points**: Summarize the basic concepts of computer networks and the Internet, emphasizing the importance of network security.
*   **Q&A Session**: Answer students' questions and encourage them to learn how to use the Internet more safely after class.

### Teaching Resources
*   **Pictures and Videos**: Show pictures of network devices and animations of network data transmission to help students visually understand the process of network communication.
*   **Interactive Props**: Such as envelopes and labels, to be used in simulating the process of data transmission in a network.

### After-Class Activity
*   **Hands-on Task**: Have students try to set up a simple home local area network (if possible) and experience sharing files on a local network.
*   **Thinking Task**: Encourage students to observe how they use the Internet in their daily lives, think about how to improve their personal network security in different scenarios, and share their findings in the next class.
