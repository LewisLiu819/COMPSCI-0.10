## Lesson 13: Image and Multimedia Programming

### Learning Objectives
1.  **Understand the basic concepts of images and multimedia**: Introduce students to how multimedia content such as images, sound, and video is represented and processed in a computer.
2.  **Learn the basics of image and multimedia programming**: Through visual programming tools, students will be able to create and control simple images, sounds, or animation effects.
3.  **Stimulate creative interest**: Allow students to experience the fun of image and multimedia programming, cultivating their ability to express creativity through programming.

### Course Outline

#### 1. Introduction (10 minutes)
*   **Introducing the Topic**: Ask students: "Do you know how photos and music are stored on a computer?" This will guide students to think about how multimedia data is represented in a computer.
*   **Preliminary Introduction**: Explain the basic concepts of images, sound, and video, and briefly describe the principles of image pixels and sound sampling to help students understand how this content is stored and processed on a computer.

#### 2. Main Content (25 minutes)
1.  **Fundamentals of Images and Sound** (10 minutes)
    *   **Image Representation**: Explain that an image is composed of individual pixels and that different images can be generated by controlling the color of these pixels. Show examples of images with different resolutions to help students understand the concept of resolution.
    *   **Sound Representation**: Introduce that sound is represented by a sample rate and bit depth, and explain the basic structure of sound waveforms and audio files.
    *   **Multimedia File Formats**: Briefly introduce common multimedia formats (such as JPG, PNG, MP3, MP4, etc.) to familiarize students with different types of multimedia data.

2.  **Basic Operations of Multimedia Programming** (10 minutes)
    *   **Image Processing**: In a visual programming tool, demonstrate how to load and display an image, such as adjusting its size, rotating it, and setting its transparency.
    *   **Sound Control**: Show how to add and control sound effects. Through simple audio playback commands, students can experience controlling background music and sound effects.
    *   **Animation Creation**: Demonstrate how to create animation effects, such as a character's movement or transformation, by changing images frame by frame or using preset animation effects.

3.  **Multimedia Programming Practice** (5 minutes)
    *   **Mini-Project Example**: Have students design a simple interactive scene, such as "character and background interaction," by programming the background music, character movement, and dialogue bubbles.
    *   **Task Practice**: Students can add different multimedia elements (such as images and sounds) and explore how to coordinate and combine them to achieve rich visual and auditory effects.

#### 3. Interactive Session: Creating a Multimedia Project (10 minutes)
*   **Group Project**: Students work in groups to design and write a small multimedia project, such as an "interactive story" or a "simple game," using images, sound, and animation to create scene and character interactions.
*   **Project Showcase**: Each group presents their project, sharing their creative ideas and the process of implementing the multimedia effects, which helps cultivate their creative and presentation skills.

#### 4. Conclusion and Q&A (5 minutes)
*   **Review of Key Points**: Summarize the basic operations and concepts of multimedia, including images, sound, and animation, in programming.
*   **Q&A Session**: Answer students' questions and encourage them to use multimedia programming tools to create their own creative works after class.

### Teaching Resources
*   **Visual Programming Tools**: Such as Scratch or similar tools that support image, sound, and animation operations.
*   **Multimedia Assets**: Prepare some basic images, sound effect files, and simple animation assets for students to use in their practice.

### After-Class Activity
*   **Hands-on Task**: Have students try to design a small animation or interactive project at home using a multimedia programming tool and record their creative process.
*   **Thinking Task**: Encourage students to think about which multimedia elements in their daily lives could be implemented through programming, such as phone ringtones or animated emojis, and share them in the next class.
