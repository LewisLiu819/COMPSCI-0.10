# Lesson 13.1: Digital Citizenship and Online Safety

Welcome, superheroes! To be a true hero of the digital world, you need a special toolkit to help you stay safe and be a positive force for good. Today, we'll build that toolkit together.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of your training, you'll be able to:
- Explain what a "digital footprint" is and why it's important to be thoughtful online.
- Create a super-strong, easy-to-remember password.
- Know the #1 rule for what to do if you see something online that makes you feel weird or uncomfortable.
- Help create a class promise to always be kind and safe online.

## Your Superhero Training Plan

### Your Digital Footprint (15 minutes)
- Let's imagine we're walking on a muddy path. We'd leave footprints, right? The internet is similar! Everything we do online leaves a **digital footprint**.
- We'll talk about why we want our footprints to be positive and kind. The key is to **THINK before you click!**
- Let's brainstorm: What are some examples of positive footprints we can leave online?

### The Secret Password Workshop (15 minutes)
- Your secret identity is important! A strong password is like a lock on the door to your superhero hideout.
- We'll learn the secret recipe for a strong password: make it long, mix it up (letters, numbers!), and make it something you can remember but is hard for others to guess.
- Your mission: Create your own new, super-strong password on our practice worksheet. (Don't share it!)

### The Most Important Rule (15 minutes)
- We'll look at some simple online situations. Some are fun, but some might feel a little weird.
- We'll learn the most important superhero rule of the internet: **If you're not sure, or if something makes you feel uncomfortable, STOP and ask a trusted adult for help.**
- We will practice what to say and who our trusted adults are (parents, teachers, family members).

### Our Superhero Pledge (5 minutes)
- Let's work together to create a simple promise for our class.
- This will be our **Digital Citizenship Pledge**, a list of rules we all agree to follow to keep our online community safe and fun for everyone.

## Your Superhero Toolkit
- A fun way to show a "digital footprint" (maybe with paint or chalk!)
- Worksheets to practice creating super-strong passwords
- Simple "what would you do?" scenario cards
- A big poster for our class's Digital Citizenship Pledge
