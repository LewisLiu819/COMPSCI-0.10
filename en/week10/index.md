# Week 10: Game Design and Interactive Experiences

**Unit:** Creative Computing (Weeks 9-11)
**Duration:** 2 lessons, 50 minutes each

## Week Overview

Week 10 focuses on game design principles and creating interactive experiences. Students learn what makes games engaging and fun, then apply design thinking to create their own simple interactive games using programming concepts.

## Learning Goals

By the end of Week 10, students will be able to:
- Analyze what elements make games engaging and fun
- Apply design thinking principles to game creation
- Implement basic game mechanics using programming
- Create complete interactive games with clear objectives
