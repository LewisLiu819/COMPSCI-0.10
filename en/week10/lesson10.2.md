# Lesson 10.2: Creating Simple Interactive Games

Welcome, game developers! You've analyzed what makes a game fun and designed your own amazing concept. Now it's time to open your game studio, fire up the computers, and bring your idea to life with code!

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this workshop, you'll be able to:
- Use code to create the basic parts of a game (like player controls and goals).
- Build a simple, playable game with a clear way to win.
- Test your game to find and fix any bugs.
- Design a game that is easy for a new player to understand and play.

## Your Game Development Plan

### From Plan to Program (12 minutes)
- Let's review our game design plans from last lesson.
- We'll look at a few simple game examples in Scratch Jr. (like a catching game or a maze game) and see how they are programmed.
- Based on your plan, we'll choose a simple and achievable goal for your first game. Remember, starting simple is the key to success!

### Game Development Workshop (30 minutes)
- It's time to build! Let's get programming.
- Your first mission is to build the most important part of your game: the **core gameplay**. (e.g., making your character move, making objects appear).
- Once that works, you can add the other key parts:
  - A way to **win** (like reaching a finish line or touching an object).
  - Clear **instructions** for the player.
- Your teacher will be your lead developer, helping you solve problems and debug your code.

### "Play-Testing" and Feedback (8 minutes)
- Every real game goes through testing! It's time to let a friend play your game.
- Watch them play. Do they understand the goal? Is it fun? Are there any bugs?
- Use their feedback to make quick improvements to your game.

## Your Developer's Toolkit
- Your device with Scratch Jr.
- Your game design worksheet from our last lesson
- A simple feedback form for our "play-testers"
- A big round of applause for every finished game!

## How to Be a Star Developer
- Did you successfully turn your design plan into a working program?
- **The "It Works!" Test:** Does your game have a clear goal and a way for the player to win?
- Your finished, playable game is a massive accomplishment and proves you're a real game developer!

## New Tech Words to Master
- **Game Loop:** The main part of a game's code that runs over and over, checking for player actions and updating the screen.
- **User Interface (UI):** The buttons, text, and screens that a player uses to interact with your game.
- **Testing:** The process of playing a game to find bugs and see what needs to be improved.
- **Implementation:** The process of taking your design plan and actually building it with code.
