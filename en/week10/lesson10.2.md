# Lesson 10.2: Creating Simple Interactive Games

**Duration:** 50 minutes
**Format:** Project-Based Programming + Game Development
**Unit:** Creative Computing (Week 9-11)

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Implement basic game mechanics using programming
- Create games with clear goals and user interaction
- Apply debugging skills to game development
- Design user-friendly game interfaces

## Lesson Structure

### Game Programming Basics (12 minutes)
- Review programming concepts needed for games
- Demonstrate simple game examples (catching, maze, quiz)
- Plan programming approach for different game types
- Choose game type based on programming skill level

### Game Development Workshop (30 minutes)
- Students program their planned games
- Focus on core game loop: setup, play, win/lose conditions
- Add game elements progressively: characters, obstacles, scoring
- Teacher provides individual coaching and troubleshooting

### Game Testing and Debugging (8 minutes)
- Students test their own games extensively
- Partner testing for feedback and bug identification
- Quick improvements based on testing results
- Celebrate working games and learning from challenges
