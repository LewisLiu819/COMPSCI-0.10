## Lesson 12: Fundamentals of Robotics Programming

### Learning Objectives
1.  **Understand the basic concepts of robotics programming**: Introduce students to the components of a robot and its basic working principles, helping them understand how robots achieve automated operations through programs.
2.  **Learn basic robot commands and control**: Through simple programming commands, students will experience how to control a robot's actions and reactions.
3.  **Develop hands-on skills and logical thinking**: Through practical activities, students will learn to write commands and plan tasks, stimulating their interest in robotics.

### Course Outline

#### 1. Introduction (10 minutes)
*   **Introducing the Topic**: Ask students: "What kinds of robots have you seen? How do you think robots move?" This will lead to a discussion about the applications of robots in daily life.
*   **Preliminary Introduction**: Briefly explain the basic components of a robot, such as sensors, control systems, and actuators, to help students understand how robots "perceive" and "act."

#### 2. Main Content (25 minutes)
1.  **Components and Working Principles of a Robot** (10 minutes)
    *   **Basic Components**: Introduce the core components of a robot, including sensors, a control system, and actuators.
    *   **Working Principles**: Explain the control principles of a robot, showing that a robot receives commands through a program and adjusts its actions based on sensor feedback.
    *   **Simple Demonstration**: Show a basic robot (such as an educational robot) to give students a visual understanding of its components and their functions.

2.  **Basic Robot Commands and Control** (10 minutes)
    *   **The Role of Programming Commands**: Introduce some simple programming commands, such as forward, backward, turn, and stop.
    *   **Task Demonstration**: Demonstrate how to control a robot to complete a simple task, such as walking in a straight line or turning.
    *   **Student Practice**: Have students use basic commands to control a robot, completing simple actions like moving a certain distance or avoiding an obstacle.

3.  **Robot Task Programming** (5 minutes)
    *   **Task Description**: Have students try to write a program to complete a simple task, such as moving a robot from a starting point to a designated endpoint or patrolling a specific area.
    *   **Discussion and Feedback**: Students present the programs they have written, and the teacher provides feedback to help them understand how to optimize their control commands.

#### 3. Interactive Session: Collaborating on a Robot Task (10 minutes)
*   **Team Task**: Students work in groups to design and write a program to control a robot to complete a small task, such as "maze navigation" or "object detection."
*   **Task Demonstration**: Each group presents their results, sharing the challenges of the task and the programming process, which helps cultivate teamwork and innovation.

#### 4. Conclusion and Q&A (5 minutes)
*   **Review of Key Points**: Summarize the basic concepts and commands of robotics programming, emphasizing the role of robots in automated operations.
*   **Q&A Session**: Answer students' questions and encourage them to think about the working principles of other automated devices in their daily lives after class.

### Teaching Resources
*   **Educational Robots**: Such as basic educational robot kits (like LEGO Mindstorms or Makeblock) for students to operate.
*   **Demonstration Videos**: Show the application scenarios of different types of robots to help students understand the use of robots in various fields.

### After-Class Activity
*   **Hands-on Task**: Have students observe how robots or other automated devices work at home and record the steps they take to complete a task.
*   **Thinking Task**: Encourage students to think about possible future applications for robots and share their ideas in the next class, such as "home cleaning robots" or "library book-borrowing robots."
