## Lesson 10: Introduction to Big Data and Data Analysis

### Learning Objectives
1.  **Understand the concept of big data**: Help students gain a preliminary understanding of what big data is and its wide range of applications in daily life.
2.  **Understand the basics of data analysis**: Through simple data analysis case studies, students will learn how to discover interesting information from data.
3.  **Cultivate data awareness**: Stimulate students' interest in data, encouraging them to observe and analyze data in their daily lives and develop a habit of data-driven thinking.

### Course Outline

#### 1. Introduction (10 minutes)
*   **Introducing the Topic**: Ask students: "Do you know how much information is generated online every day?" This will guide students to think about the data that exists in their lives and how it can be used.
*   **Preliminary Introduction**: Briefly introduce the concept of "big data," explaining that with technological advancements, the volume of data is rapidly increasing, and "data analysis" is the process of extracting useful information from this data.

#### 2. Main Content (25 minutes)
1.  **What is Big Data?** (10 minutes)
    *   **Definition of Big Data**: Introduce that big data is composed of large, diverse, and rapidly changing data. Use familiar examples, such as data from social media or weather data.
    *   **Applications of Big Data**: Show the applications of big data in daily life, such as movie recommendations, ad placements on social platforms, and pandemic tracking. Use real-life examples to help students understand the importance of big data.

2.  **Basics of Data Analysis** (10 minutes)
    *   **Data Collection and Organization**: Briefly explain how data is collected and organized. Give examples, such as collecting data through surveys or online sources.
    *   **Data Analysis Methods**: Use graphical methods to show how to observe data trends, patterns, etc. For example, show the changing trends in weather data to help students understand the process of data analysis.

3.  **Case Study: The Story in the Data** (5 minutes)
    *   **Mini Case Study**: Use a simple data analysis case (such as students' daily schedules) to demonstrate how to find interesting patterns in data. Let students see how data can "tell a story" and reveal hidden information.
    *   **Interactive Discussion**: Guide students to discuss other data in their lives that can be analyzed (such as daily steps, time spent online, etc.) and think about how to draw interesting conclusions from it.

#### 3. Interactive Session: Design Your Own Small Data Analysis Project (10 minutes)
*   **Project Introduction**: Students choose a topic, such as "the class's favorite snack" or "daily study time," and collect data through simple methods (like a questionnaire) for a preliminary analysis.
*   **Group Discussion**: Students discuss in groups how to collect, organize, and present the data, enhancing their practical understanding of data analysis.

#### 4. Conclusion and Q&A (5 minutes)
*   **Review of Key Points**: Summarize the concept of big data and the basic process of data analysis.
*   **Q&A Session**: Answer students' questions and encourage them to pay more attention to data collection and analysis in their daily lives.

### Teaching Resources
*   **Pictures and Videos**: Show practical applications of big data, such as recommendation systems and traffic monitoring, to help students understand the real-world impact of big data.
*   **Charting Tools**: Such as simple chart generation tools to help students display and analyze data.

### After-Class Activity
*   **Hands-on Task**: Have students choose a small topic (such as "types of fruit eaten daily"), collect data for a week, and present the results in a chart.
*   **Thinking Task**: Have students think about where data analysis can be applied in their daily lives and share their ideas in the next class.
