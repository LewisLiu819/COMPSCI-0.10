## Lesson 7: Event-Driven Programming

### Learning Objectives
1.  **Understand the concept of event-driven programming**: Help students understand the basic principles of event-driven programming and its importance in software development.
2.  **Learn how to use events in visual programming**: Students will be able to set up event responses in visual programming tools, allowing programs to react to events like clicks and keyboard input.
3.  **Cultivate interactive design thinking**: By implementing simple interactive projects, students will enhance their understanding of user input and program responses.

### Course Outline

#### 1. Introduction (10 minutes)
*   **Introducing the Topic**: Ask students: "When you click a button, how does the computer know what you clicked?" This will guide students to think about how computers respond to user actions.
*   **Preliminary Introduction**: Explain how "event-driven programming" allows a program to react to events (such as clicks, touches, or keyboard input).

#### 2. Main Content (25 minutes)
1.  **Basic Concepts of Event-Driven Programming** (5 minutes)
    *   **Definition of an Event**: Introduce that an event is an action triggered by the user's interaction with the program, such as a mouse click or a key press.
    *   **Event Response Mechanism**: Use a simple example to illustrate how a program responds with preset instructions when an event occurs, creating an interaction between the user and the program.

2.  **Basic Methods of Event Handling** (10 minutes)
    *   **Demonstrating Event Modules**: Show the event modules in a visual programming tool (such as "when space key pressed" or "when this sprite clicked").
    *   **Task Practice**: Have students set up events in visual programming. For example, when the user clicks a character, it performs an action like jumping or rotating.

3.  **Comprehensive Application: Creating an Interactive Project** (10 minutes)
    *   **Project Description**: Guide students to design a simple interactive project, such as a "Whack-a-Mole" game, where a character disappears and a score is kept when it is clicked.
    *   **Team Collaboration**: Students work in groups to complete the project, reinforcing their understanding of the event response mechanism and exercising their collaboration and creative design skills.

#### 3. Work Display and Discussion (10 minutes)
*   **Work Display**: Each group presents their interactive project, sharing the creativity and implementation methods of their project.
*   **Discussion and Feedback**: Other students can offer suggestions or ask questions to help the presenting group improve their design.

#### 4. Conclusion and Q&A (5 minutes)
*   **Review of Key Points**: Summarize the concept of event-driven programming and its application scenarios.
*   **Q&A Session**: Answer students' questions and encourage them to continue trying to design different event responses after class.

### Teaching Resources
*   **Visual Programming Platform**: Such as Scratch, used to demonstrate the basic operations of event-driven programming.
*   **Sample Projects**: Prepare some simple interactive mini-games to help students understand the effects of event-driven programming.

### After-Class Activity
*   **Hands-on Task**: Have students design a mini-game or interactive animation using at least two different event responses.
*   **Thinking Task**: Encourage students to think about other common "events" and their responses in daily life (such as elevator buttons, doorbells, etc.) and share them in the next class.
