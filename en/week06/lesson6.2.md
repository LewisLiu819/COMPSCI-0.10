# Lesson 6.2: Yes/No Adventure Programming

**Duration:** 50 minutes
**Format:** Interactive Story Creation + Advanced Conditionals
**Unit:** Problem Solving and Logic (Week 6-8)

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Create branching narratives with multiple pathways
- Program complex conditional statements
- Design user-friendly interactive experiences
- Plan and organize multi-step programming projects

## Lesson Structure

### Story Structure Analysis (10 minutes)
- Review choose-your-own-adventure book structure
- Map out decision trees on the board
- Identify how Boolean (yes/no) choices create different story paths
- Plan story with 3-4 decision points

### Advanced Programming Techniques (15 minutes)
- Learn to use message broadcasting for story branching
- Practice programming multiple scenes or pages
- Demonstrate how to create smooth transitions between story parts
- Introduce background changes and character costume changes

### Interactive Story Creation (20 minutes)
- Students create their adventure stories with multiple choices
- Focus on logical story flow and clear user instructions
- Implement at least 3 decision points with different outcomes
- Add visual and audio elements to enhance storytelling

### User Testing and Feedback (5 minutes)
- Partner testing of interactive stories
- Feedback on clarity of choices and story logic
- Quick improvements based on user experience
- Save projects for continued work

## Materials Needed
- Story planning templates with decision tree diagrams
- Devices with Scratch Jr.
- Example interactive story for demonstration
- User testing feedback forms
- Timer for activity transitions

## Assessment

### Formative
- Quality of story planning and organization
- Successful implementation of branching logic
- User-friendly design and clear instructions
- Responsiveness to feedback during testing

### Summative
Complete interactive story with at least 3 functional choice points and logical narrative flow.
