# Lesson 6.1: True or False Detective Agency

Welcome, detectives! Your first case awaits. Today, our agency will learn the most important detective skill: telling the difference between what's TRUE and what's FALSE. This is the key to solving any mystery and the secret behind how computers make decisions.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of your first case, you'll be able to:
- Look at a clue (a statement) and determine if it's true or false.
- Use logic and reasoning to solve simple mysteries.
- Understand that computers think in a simple "true/false" way called Boolean logic.
- Program a sprite to make a decision based on a true/false condition.

## Your Detective Mission

### Basic Training: The True/False Game (12 minutes)
- Let's warm up our brains with a game of "True or False," using silly statements about our classroom.
- We'll introduce the official term: **Boolean logic**. It's just a cool way of saying that computers see everything as either true or false.
- Let's get moving! We'll make one side of the room the "True Zone" and the other the "False Zone," and you'll move to the side you think is correct.

### Case File #1: The Logic Puzzles (18 minutes)
- Time for your first assignment. You'll work in detective teams to solve a series of logic puzzles.
- Your only tools are the clues you're given. You'll need to figure out which clues are true to eliminate suspects and find the solution.
- This is all about systematic thinking! We'll celebrate how different teams crack the case.

### Programming Your First Decision (15 minutes)
- Now, let's teach our sprites to be detectives!
- We'll create simple programs that make a decision. For example: "**If** the sprite is tapped, **then** it will say 'You found a clue!'"
- You'll get to experiment with different "true/false" conditions to see how you can make your sprite react.

### Debriefing the Case (5 minutes)
- Let's share our winning strategies. How did you solve the puzzles?
- We'll discuss how breaking down a big mystery into small true/false questions makes it easier to solve.

## Your Detective Toolkit
- A "True Zone" and a "False Zone" marked in our classroom
- Top-secret logic puzzle case files
- Your device with Scratch Jr.
- Official detective badges or hats to get us in the zone!

## How to Be a Top Detective
- We'll see how quickly and accurately you can sort statements into "true" or "false."
- **Case Closed?:** How did your team use logic to solve the puzzles?
- Your ability to program a simple "if... then..." decision in Scratch Jr. will show you've mastered the basic logic.

## New Tech Words to Master
- **Boolean Logic:** A fancy way of saying "true or false" logic, which is how computers make all their decisions.
- **Condition:** Something that the computer checks to see if it is true or false.
- **Reasoning:** Using facts and clues to think through a problem.
- **Evidence:** The clues you use to prove that something is true or false.
