# Lesson 6.1: True or False Detective Agency

**Duration:** 50 minutes
**Format:** Logic Games + Boolean Thinking
**Unit:** Problem Solving and Logic (Week 6-8)

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Distinguish between true and false statements
- Apply logical reasoning to solve simple problems
- Understand that computers work with true/false logic
- Create programs that make decisions based on conditions

## Lesson Structure

### Boolean Logic Introduction (12 minutes)
- Play "True or False" with silly statements about the class
- Introduce Boolean as "computer true/false"
- Physical activity: Students move to "True" or "False" sides of room
- Connect to how computers make decisions

### Detective Logic Puzzles (18 minutes)
- Present age-appropriate logic puzzles
- Students work in teams to solve mysteries using true/false clues
- Practice systematic thinking and elimination
- Celebrate different problem-solving approaches

### Programming Boolean Decisions (15 minutes)
- Create simple programs that respond differently to true/false conditions
- Example: "If sprite is touched, then change color"
- Students experiment with different Boolean conditions
- Practice debugging when conditions don't work as expected

### Logic Challenge Reflection (5 minutes)
- Share successful problem-solving strategies
- Discuss how breaking big problems into smaller true/false questions helps
- Preview upcoming programming challenges

## Materials Needed
- True/False movement space in classroom
- Logic puzzle worksheets appropriate for grade level
- Devices with Scratch Jr.
- Detective badges or hats for engagement
- Chart paper for recording problem-solving strategies
