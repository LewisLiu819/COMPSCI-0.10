# Week 6: Boolean Logic and Decision Making

**Unit:** Problem Solving and Logic (Weeks 6-8)
**Duration:** 2 lessons, 50 minutes each

## Week Overview

Week 6 begins Unit 3 by introducing students to Boolean logic and systematic decision-making. Through detective games and logic puzzles, students learn to think systematically about true/false conditions and create programs that make decisions based on logic.

## Learning Goals

By the end of Week 6, students will be able to:
- Distinguish between true and false statements systematically
- Apply logical reasoning to solve problems
- Understand how computers use Boolean logic for decisions
- Create interactive programs with branching narratives

## Lessons This Week

### [Lesson 6.1: True or False Detective Agency](lesson6.1.md)
**Format:** Logic Games + Boolean Thinking

Students become logic detectives, learning to work with true/false statements and solving mysteries through systematic reasoning and evidence-based thinking.

**Key Activities:**
- Boolean logic introduction with physical activities
- Detective logic puzzles and team problem-solving
- Programming Boolean conditions and responses
- Logic challenge reflection and strategy sharing

**Vocabulary:** Boolean, Logic, Condition, True/False, Reasoning, Evidence

### [Lesson 6.2: Yes/No Adventure Programming](lesson6.2.md)
**Format:** Interactive Story Creation + Advanced Conditionals

Students create sophisticated branching narratives with multiple decision points, applying Boolean logic to create engaging user experiences.

**Key Activities:**
- Story structure analysis and decision tree mapping
- Advanced programming with message broadcasting
- Interactive story creation with multiple pathways
- User testing and feedback implementation

**Vocabulary:** Branching, Decision tree, User experience, Navigation, Message broadcasting

## Assessment Highlights

- **Formative:** Logic puzzle solving, Boolean condition implementation
- **Performance:** Logic reasoning demonstrations and problem-solving approaches
- **Summative:** Complete interactive story with functional choice points and logical flow

## Critical Thinking Skills

- Systematic approach to problem-solving
- Evidence-based reasoning and decision-making
- Logical deduction and elimination processes
