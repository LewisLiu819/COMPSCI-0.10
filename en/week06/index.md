# Week 6: Become a Logic Detective!

**Unit:** Problem Solving and Logic (Weeks 6-8)

## What's in Store This Week?

Get your detective hats ready! This week, we're diving into the world of logic and learning how to think like a super sleuth. You'll learn about **Boolean logic**—a fancy term for thinking in "true or false." We'll play detective games, solve logic puzzles, and use this new power to build programs that can make smart decisions. It's time to sharpen your minds and teach your programs to reason like a true detective!

## What You'll Be Able to Do!

By the end of this week, you'll be able to:
- Look at a statement and decide if it's "true" or "false."
- Use clues and logical thinking to solve tricky problems.
- Understand how computers use simple "true/false" logic to make all their decisions.
- Create your own interactive adventures with even more choices and branching paths.

## Lessons This Week

### [Lesson 6.1: The True or False Detective Agency](lesson6.1.md)
**Get Ready To:** Join the detective agency! Your mission is to solve mysteries by figuring out which clues are true and which are false. You'll use systematic thinking to crack the case!

### [Lesson 6.2: Create a Super-Smart Adventure Story](lesson6.2.md)
**Get Ready To:** Build your most complex interactive story yet! You'll use your new logic skills to design an adventure with multiple decision points, leading to many different endings.
